            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving, my Children, ſpent the beſt years of my Life in the Wars, in the Service of the King, I thought I ſhould not altogether be negligent of the ſame duty, if now in my retirement, I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the remainder of my days in your inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; that ſo by diſcharging the office of a good Father, I might likewiſe perform the part of a good Subject. That I might not fall ſhort in my deſign, perceiving my ſelf already far advanc'd in Age, and you very Young, I have put in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome Inſtructions concerning your educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I have reduced to the duties of Man towards God, towards Himſelf, and towards his Neighbour; which three things, have ſo great a relation to the duty of a Subject towards his Prince, that it is abſolutely impoſſible that one can truly fear God, be morally good, or honeſt in the reciprocal offices of a civil Life, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in like manner a good Subject.</p>
            <p>To facilitate to you the means of obtaining all theſe good qualities, I make no doubt, my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb facs="tcp:29522:5"/>but that you have need of a Father more wiſe and diſcreet than I am, to guide you by his example in theſe lovely and delightful paths. The firſt delineations of good and evil, begin inſenſibly to be wrought in us at home in the Chimney-corner, by the force of that cuſtom which renders the impreſſion of Domeſtic man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners more powerful, than the reſemblance of Children to their Parents, and even than the ſeed that does beget them. And therefore a good Father ſhould brood over his Children (if I dare uſe the word) as a Tortoiſe over her Eggs, by careful watching, (as ſhe) and continual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and eying of them until they be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is the end that I propoſe, and to look ſo narrowly to my ſelf whileſt we live together, that I may not, inſtead of a Director to you, become a Complice in your faults.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing that in this my Age of threeſcore and three years, every hour, day, and year, make to me a Climacteric, I thought fit to ſupply my preſence, if that be wanting unto you, by leaving you ſome precepts for the conduct of your lives, in the form of my Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to the end that you may receive them with greater reſpect, and that after our ſeparation, it may remain as a living Model, according to which I intended to have bred and informed you. I leave the diſtribution of my other Eſtate amongſt you, to the Laws of the Countrey which (without preſuming to be wiſer than they) we cannot violate; but theſe which I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb facs="tcp:29522:5"/>diſpoſe of more profitably than I have uſed them, I leave in groſs to every one of you. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them my Children, more uſefully than I have done; for I have only had the Theory without making the application of them; I have poſſeſſed them as a covetous man his riches, without employing them to uſe, becauſe my faults have prevented my knowledge, and by the force of cuſtome, my vices enſlaved me to their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny before I could diſcover their uglineſs, for they being incarnate in me before I was aware of their infection, my reaſon, notwithſtanding all the attempts that it was willing to make, hath never ſince been able to break the invincible bonds of an evil habit. Look upon me now then, as upon a blind man, who preſents you with a Torch, wherewith he cannot light him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or rather as one that goes before his light, and carries his Torch behind him, if the ſmall Inſtructions I leave you deſerve the name of Torches.</p>
            <p>Though they be preſented to you by a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hand, which you have no reaſon to ſuſpect, yet I crave not from you a blind obedience to my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, there was never any ſeed ſo clean but that there ſtill remained in it ſome Darnel, nor tree ſo carefully dreſſed, that hath not produced ſome corrupt fruit; and therefore I charge you, that when you have attained to maturity of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you let not paſs the leaſt article or clauſe of this Will and Teſtament, without due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, without caſting and turning it every
<pb facs="tcp:29522:6"/>way, that you may ſee if unawares, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to my intention there may not ſomething have eſcaped me, which may be againſt the honour and reverence that is due to God, the King, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the Laws, or even civility and good manners, which is a kind of Policy; if ſo you do, you may perhaps by the light of your own knowledge and of mine, diſcover ſome miſtake which I have made, wherein I do forthwith ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſelf to be cleared; and by a true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination you may reject the falſe illuſion, that may have occaſioned my errour; and by the ſame trial, if the Inſtructions which I give you be employed in the conduct of your life, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them to occaſions, and frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives your mind will thereby become ſo ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that all the acts of honour and virtue will inſenſibly prove to you as natural as ſpeaking and hearing.</p>
            <p>Though this little Diſcourſe ſeem only to be addreſſed to you, my Children, in particular, yet I confeſs my intention goes farther, and that being obliged according to the counſel of the Goſpel, to conſider all men as my Brethren, and all young people as my Children, my affection in obedience to that rule conſtrains me, and (it may be) to the expence of my reputation, to leave in common to all young people, and in prey to the firſt ſeizer, the only acquiſt which I have made during the courſe of my life; I ſhould be very glad that my own had in it the greateſt ſhare; but if any other whoſoever it be, render
<pb facs="tcp:29522:6"/>himſelf more worthy of it than they, and become thereby more wiſe, I ſhall ſtill in ſome meaſure have ſatisfied my deſire; I leſſen nothing of what is yours, by my deſign of aſſociating all mankind in this Inheritance; on the contrary, I endeavour to enlarge your affinity with all men, and to procure you new Brethren, who may contract with you upon the common ſtock of this Legacy a ſpiritual Brotherhood, of ſtricter uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and more ſure than if fleſh and blood had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it.</p>
            <p>It ſhall be in this place then, Reader, where I make no difference betwixt thy Son and mine, that I will begin the firſt Article of my Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by this goodly Leſſon, that we ought all to conſider Humane Nature as a great Maſs, and total, whereof we all make ſo many different parts, and that the more each part is ſerviceable to its whole, the more it complies with its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: The eſtabliſhment of this firſt principle, will kill in us the ſeeds of Pride, Avarice, Envy, of the Luſt of the Eyes and of the Fleſh, and of an infinite number of other Vices, which ſpring from ſelf-love; and we ſhall not only find theſe accurſed Seeds thereby choaked in us, but in their place Brotherly Love and Charity ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, which is the Baſis and Foundation of all Chriſtian Virtues. When our Saviour was told that his Mother and Brethren deſired to ſpeak with him, he pointed to his Diſciples, and to all that were about him, ſaying, <hi>Theſe are my Mother, Brethren and Siſters,</hi> to ſignifie to us
<pb facs="tcp:29522:7"/>by that holy ſaying, the Brotherhood, Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity, and common alliance that we ought to have with all men. That inflamed word, which like a flaſh of fire broke forth of the mouth of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>That he deſired to be accurſed for his Brethren,</hi> was nothing elſe but a holy rage, produced by the exceſs of Charity, which he believed would be more compleat and pleaſing to God, if he choſe rather to devote himſelf for the ſalvation of his Brethren, than to be ſaved alone.</p>
            <p>Indeed man is only born for the ſervice of man, he is engaged to this duty by ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Societies, that how irregular ſoever he may be, it is impoſſible that he can break all theſe tyes, the ſame Roof, the ſame Town, the ſame State, the ſame Government, Civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic, the ſame Language, the ſame faſhion of Apparel, and an infinite number of Orders and Fraternities, are ſo many different Stages of ſubaltern Societies, by which we mount to that general union which ought to be amongſt men. Nay farther, that this harmony might not be troubled, Kings have been inſpired to call one another Brothers, to the end that their Subjects might become ſo likewiſe, and that the difference of Language, Cloathing, Manners, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſometimes of Religion, might not be able to unty the knot of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let us always be ready to do good to one another, he that renders a good office to his neighbour, attracts no leſs the good will of him
<pb facs="tcp:29522:7"/>that ſees, than of him that receives it, and by ſtretching out to him both our arms in his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, we multiply and increaſe our ſtrength by the mutual aſſiſtance to which our affection ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth him. Since we are all then ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent members of this great body, which makes up Humane Nature, it is moſt certain that we cannot be ſelfiſh, nor limit our affection to every one of our ſelves ſingly, without unmanning our ſelves in ſome manner, and making a particular divorce from that common union which we are ingaged in with all men.</p>
            <p>My Children, our whole is but a part of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whole, which is common and univerſal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; at firſt glance one would ſay, that ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us in her works, as the common mother of all things, but he that will trace her ſteps, and examine her in her progreſs, ſhall find that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Mother, ſhe is but the Nurſe and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron that receives them, and that their Being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends only upon the exiſtence of God, from whom we and all things elſe have their Being.</p>
            <p>Beſide, that in every particular thing there is an inherent appetite to preſerve its individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Being; Experience likewiſe teacheth us, that there is in it an inclination for the continuance of its kind, whoſe ſeed would notwithſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main barren and ineffectual, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and aſſiſtance of God. Otherwiſe if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture determined her ſelf to the production of the different kinds of Beings which fill the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, and that her power did not loll and ſlumber in
<pb facs="tcp:29522:8"/>ſuſpence, until the ſpirit of God gave order and diſtinction to its operations, it muſt neceſſarily follow that there ſhould be two principal cauſes of one and the ſame thing. I know not whether I explain my ſelf well enough or not, or that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume I do ſo; yet I think that in you and my ſelf, Dear Children, I diſcover ſome ſenſible beam of this truth: Is it not true that we can call no action purely and properly our own, unleſs we had before an intention to do it? A Painter will not make a Picture, nor a Carver an Image, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having firſt framed the deſign of it in his mind; and this I think is without contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Why is it then, that when ye were caſt into the mould, neither your Mother nor I did the leaſt think of you, and that that blind appetite of Nature had not at that time any other aim in us but its own ſatisfaction. I think the caſe is ſo with all other living Creatures as with man, and with the ſeeds of all things elſe contained in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe; do not you think that the ſuſpenſion of our Will in that Act, is to us a ſecret Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, that God thought fit to reſerve to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone, the care and overſeeing of a production, whereof he gives us the power, for the preſervation of our kind, without the intention? to teach all and every one of us, that he keeps the Prerogative of Paternity to himſelf, to the end that the firſt and chief Homage of our being, ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected towards him; and that we may conſider, that in the Fabric of the thing it ſelf, wherein we think to have the greateſt ſhare, we are but the
<pb facs="tcp:29522:8"/>Tools and Inſtruments of his Omnipotence.</p>
            <p>Since then, my deareſt Children, the firſt Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of you and me, comes from God, it is juſt that the firſt beam of our knowledge ſhould guide us to the Adoration of him who is our common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that my Will and Teſtament ſhould begin with that: Wherefore I ſhall divide it into three Parts:</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29522:10"/>that ſhould be preſented to it; and as the Eye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Light, without knowing the nature of it, the Soul ſhould likewiſe be diſpoſed to the Worſhip of God, and by love to unite it ſelf to him, without ſearching or curious diving into his Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch, my deareſt Children, that all the functions of your Soul are not as yet in your power, and that when you come firſt into this World, it is not the Miſtriſs of your heart to make an obligation thereof to God, your ſpeech muſt ſupply that defect, and be the firſt Sacrifice that is offered up unto him: trouble not your ſelves then, if the ſenſe of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which your Mother or I make, you daily repeat, be at preſent as unknown to you, as is the nature of him to whom it is addreſſed; only follow us, our Faith gives life to your imperfect fambling, and aſſure your ſelves that there is no incenſe more acceptable to God; than this firſt ſacrifice of your lips, the firſt fruits of them are due to him, in expectation that your intention will accompany them, by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the obligation that you have to adore him, let us ſee if we can attain to that.</p>
                  <p>My Child, if I ask you who is your Father, you will immediately anſwer that it is I, and if I ask you who is my Father, you will tell me that it is another Father, and my Fathers Father ſtill another; ſo that that progreſs would aſcend infinitely from Father to Father, if it did not ſtop, and end in a common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all mankind.</p>
                  <p>The caſe is ſo with all created beings, that have a common original with your ſelf; for if they had made themſelves the deſire of preſervation, which is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from, and rooted in the creature, would never leave them.</p>
                  <p>So that there would never have hapned any change, nature would have always continued one and the ſame, and never would have entertained her ſelf by a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29522:10"/>ſucceſſion of viciſſitudes, as ſhe hath done. We muſt hold it then for certain, that there is a fixt and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent being, which is the common principle of all others, beyond which there is no progreſs; and which by conſequence ought to be the outmoſt limit of our Inquiſition, and Nature her ſelf tells us ſo.</p>
                  <p>That Divine Form of Prayer which God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to dictate to us from the mouth of his own Son, confirms the ſame; when he tells us that he is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he would have us to underſtand that he is yours, mine, and every mans elſe; and that ſo we are all Brethren, and therefore as Brethren obliged to love one another, and to reverence him as the common Father of us all. And when he tells us afterwards that his habitation is in Heaven, it ſhould inſtruct us that our curioſity ſhould reſt ſatisfied in knowing that he is our Father, without attempting to enquire far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into his Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>The vaſt paſſage that is between us and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, their ſolidity and infinite ſpaces which divide them from one another, are ſo many different inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of our common diſtance and ſeparation; and though their motion with that of the Sun, Moon, and other Planets, which are faſtned to them, have not as yet diſcovered to us but nine Spheres, yet have we credentials to aſſure us that their number is not as great or it may be greater than that of the Stars. To meaſure immenſity, all the extent of our Imagination makes not ſo much as a ſmall point in reſpect of its greatneſs.</p>
                  <p>My Son, you cannot know a man one hundred paces off, and would you know the Majeſty of God at ſo great a diſtance? That cannot be. Be contented to know that he is your Father, that the double arch of Cryſtal which covers the upper and under face of all the Earth is his dwelling place, and that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29522:11"/>this Divine Palace can no more be meaſured than its Inhabitant.</p>
                  <p>You ſee the Heavens in all their appearances, and are not yet able to comprehend of what Matter they are compoſed, the Exiſtence of God diſcovers it ſelf unto you in all his Creatures, when notwithſtanding you cannot conceive his Eſſence. Heaven hides it from you, and the ſame light which opens to you the gate of its concavity, ſhuts that of its convexity; with this difference, that this Heavenly vault appears to our eyes fixed, and nevertheleſs it moves; and God in all the works of Nature ſeems in endleſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and notwithſtanding it is he alone that is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And as it is impoſſible for you to conceive a thing in motion, without an immoveable point from which the motion proceeds, ſo no more can you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the progreſs and regreſs which you ſee in all created beings, without arriving inſenſibly at the immoveable point, from whence it hath its riſe, which is the ſame God that is your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>It was not without reaſon that we were forbidden to make to our ſelves any graven Image of any thing that is above in the Heavens, to worſhip them; for this prohibition regards as much him that frames to himſelf a model of them in his mind, as him that graves them with an Inſtrument. We cannot know them but as they preſent themſelves to our Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and our Imagination being but a vain Image of our Fancy, can no ſooner be ſhaped in our mind, but that our ſelf-love makes it its Idol.</p>
                  <p>So that, my Child, buſie not thy ſelf in the ſearch of the number of the Heavens, what diſtance there is betwixt them, and what is their greatneſs in reſpect of the Earth, it is too vaſt a ſpeculation, and more ſpongy than the brain that entertains it, the ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which by Algebra you may make thereof (the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29522:11"/>very name of which makes me afraid) will fill your mind with ſo many Fractions, that poſſibly it may crack your wit.</p>
                  <p>All the rovings that are in vogue upon this ſubject, are but the idle skippings of curious Wits, that would tranſgreſs the limits preſcribed to the capacity of Man, and ſo we ſee that ſuch perſons are but of very little uſe in Civil Society. Nature hath ſtretched a Veil of two eye-lids over your eyes to teach you, that the beams of your knowledge ſhould dart downwards and reflect upon your ſelf alone. She hath levelled your ſight with the Horizon, to point out unto you that your curioſity ſhould ſtop upon the confines of Heaven. Your eye can no more than your mind look up above you, without the overſetting of your head and brain.</p>
                  <p>If you will follow my advice, in the contemplation of Heaven, look upon it with ſilence and reverence, as the houſe of God. Conſider the Sun (according to the modern opinion) as a fixed point, or rather as the Center of that great wheel of the Univerſe, by which is derived to it that fountain of Light which does il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate, and fruitful Spirit which enlivens the ſame. The great Creator of all things knowing that our weakneſs could not bear the ſight of his Majeſty, that he might not altogether conceal himſelf from us, was pleaſed perhaps to open a point in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, through which a ſmall thread only of his glory and light (which is the ſun) might deſcend, which is nothing elſe but a material ſtamp and viſible draught of that inviſible power which governs and cheriſheth this great Univerſe. That Divine chink appears to you but ſmall in reſpect of the Heavens, yet you muſt know that though the whole Celeſtial Canopy did ſhine with the ſame brightneſs, hardly would it be a glimpſe of light, if compared to that living Luminary from whence that Divine fire proceeds. However ſuch
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29522:12"/>as it is, there is nothing created that doth with more ſplendour and pomp, preſent to our underſtanding a more perfect notion of the Omnipotence of God, than the fruitful and indefatigable vertue of the Sun, which ſtirs up nature to action, and rouſes all ſeminal cauſes from idleneſs.</p>
                  <p>Can any thing repreſent to us a more lively image of his grace, the preſence or abſence of which gives day or night to our ſouls? And what can make us better underſtand the uniformity of his goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all his Creatures, than the regular courſe of the Sun, who keeps ſo equal a ballance between the two oppoſite Poles, that there is not ſo much as one living Creature, one Plant, or one corner of the Earth, which enjoys a minutes time more of his Light than another.</p>
                  <p>He diſpenſeth it with ſo much exactneſs, that to render every where the day equal to the night, in thoſe places where there is inequality, he ſucceſſively compenſates long nights by long days, before that he accompliſh his intire Revolution.</p>
                  <p>By this Analogy of the properties of the Sun with the Attributes of God, I pretend not (contrary to his prohibition) to have engraven his Image, he himſelf hath cut it out, and made this chink in the Heavens, through which that ſcantling of his Omnipotence comes down to us. He communicates himſelf to us that way, as in jealouſie to let us know that he is, but not what he is. Propoſe not then to your ſelf to eye him at nearer diſtance: The higheſt effort that your Soul can make towards his Perfection, is not ſo much as a ſpark of his Glory. Nothing that is yours can be attributed to him, without a diminution of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>My Child, if you would come near and ſee him, there is no other way for it, but to ſtand off and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelf as much as poſſibly you can, you exalt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29522:12"/>your ſelf by falling low. O ſtrange wonder! by theſe two extremities, that is, by the higheſt notion that we conceive of God, and the loweſt ſenſe of our own unworthineſs, we may by ſtepping backwards return towards, and reunite our ſelves with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine principle.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. In what manner God is to be Worſhipped. Of Chriſtian Religion, and that one cannot be a good Subject without being a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. That no innovations ought to be made in Religion. Of the excellence of Faith above Reaſon.</head>
                  <p>LET us reſt ſatisfied then, ſeeing that Nature and God himſelf tells us that he is our Father, to render him the reſpect and obedience of a Son: and ſince that it hath pleaſed him to hide himſelf in the high and unſearchable places of Heaven, let us be contented according to his appointment to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie his holy Name. Admire in that, my Son, the goodneſs of God that deſcends to you, ſeeing that you cannot mount up to him.</p>
                  <p>This firſt cauſe being infinite, inconceivable, and unlimited, perceiving that it was not in your power to ſupport your ſelf in the troubleſome floods of ſo many thouſand wild and ſhapeleſs notions which you muſt forge to repreſent him to your ſelf, and that you were incapable of a Religion purely intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual and mental, hath been pleaſed to limit mans worſhip of God by the adoration of the name only that deſigns him to our capacity, and not as he is in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29522:13"/>himſelf, to the end that our Devotion might have a fixt and determinate object. For in effect it is Man an earthly and material Creature, who believes and prays, and who by conſequent hath need that the divine Majeſty ſhould reveal himſelf to him by ſuch means as might bear ſome proportion with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: and therefore it hath pleaſed him to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to us the inviſible grace of his Sacraments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der viſible ſigns, to appoint us a verbal Prayer, and to ſuffer the external Ceremonies that are uſed in the Church to accompany our Adoration. This is not all, he hath taken to himſelf fleſh like yours, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come man, that he might at the ſame time be your Saviour, and the guide to your Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Son, this is the foundation of the Chriſtian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and Apoſtolick doctrine, wherein I adviſe you not only to live and dye, but abſolutely command you, if you deſire to have Gods bleſſing and mine. This is the Religion of your Fathers in the very firſt Ages of the Church; let your Religion, as your blood, be one with theirs: I it is the moſt antient, the old and ſtately Fabricks, where the exerciſe of it is continued to this day, may confirm you in that.</p>
                  <p>A ſmall number of Separatiſts, who like miſled ſheep have forſaken the flock, are but the droſs of the whole. Laſtly, it is the publick Religion of the State, which you cannot renounce without becoming guilty of Faction and Sedition, or ſuſpected of it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the King. Indeed, if Obedience which is due to the King be but a dependency on Religion, which rallies together our wills in the ſervice of God, it is moſt juſt that we ſhould enter with him, and he with us, into the Society of this common Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The true Chriſtian Religion hath continued lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than any Government or Policy whatſoever now extant, &amp; more powerfully aſſerted the rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29522:13"/>of Civil Magiſtracy than any other, &amp; would you now put the truth of it to Arbitration? Know, my Son, that you can never be a good Chriſtian, if you be not a good Subject; and that there is nothing that more convinces Fanaticks of error and falſhood, than their rebellion againſt the King: the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine expreſly commands us to obey him, and to ſubmit to the Laws and Magiſtrates. You cannot, (as hath been heretofore done) trample on their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, under what pretext ſoever, but that you daſh in pieces one of the Tables of the Law againſt the other.</p>
                  <p>Be ſtedfaſt then in the Religion of your Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and of the State; withdraw not your ſelf from it, though there may be ſome depravation in the manners of thoſe that are the Miniſters of it, yea even ſome abuſes in its Government, that corruption is but a peccant humor in ſome part of the body, which is inconſiderable in reſpect of the whole, and may be cured or evacuated by Repentance. As to our abuſes, if any there be, look upon them as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of our fear, or of our love of God, which hath its being but in the ſuperfice of our Faith, like bliſters and warts that break out on our skin without cutting or exulcerating the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>The moſt dangerous hurts in the body of man are thoſe which make the greateſt ſolution of its conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, and the deepeſt wound. The ſcandal moſt to be feared in the Church of God, is when Schiſm and Hereſie divide and cut into two or more Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons its unity, which like the garment of our Saviour ſhould be without a ſeam.</p>
                  <p>Before that the lips of ſuch wounds be joined again and conſolidated into a cicatrice, men commit and ſuffer ſo many ſtrange evils, that were they but fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen by thoſe that cauſe them, I doubt not but that their zeal, whatever it might be, would eaſily comply with the received opinions.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:29522:14"/>
                  <p>Then would the external peace of the Church drop internal peace into the Conſciences of the faithful, the vapours of their contention would turn their brains no more, and inſtead of the diviſions that are amongſt us, we ſhould ſee mens minds reconciled and ferment together by the heat of charity, and the labour of thoſe who write and read Controverſies, changed into works and treatiſes of Piety and Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which is a far more innocent and Chriſtian ſubject than the other.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me to have been great preſumption in our Fanaticks, to endeavour the ſubjecting of the publick received cuſtoms of the Church, to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and correction of a private ſufficiency, and of their own authority, and without a call to enter into the inheritance of our ſalvation, whereof we and our Fathers have been in poſſeſſion before them. Every innovation in the matter of Religion, though it were good, is at preſent very dangerous in reſpect of the times, when nothing can be changed without hazarding very much.</p>
                  <p>The tempeſts that for many years have toſſed the Church of God, are not as yet wholly appeaſed, and ſhall we furniſh matter of a new ſtorm; and at this time, when all <hi>Europe</hi> is in Arms, and that the mind of man was never more curious of novelty than it is at preſent?</p>
                  <p>It is, in my mind, much ſafer and more conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to conform to the received opinions when they are peaceable, than dangerouſly to admit of any new. Hardly can there be any Covenant made in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Policy, but that immediately after it degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates into ſome civil faction, from whence all publick diſorders gather ſtrength and vigor.</p>
                  <p>Once therefore, my Child, I counſel you to be a little reſerved, when there comes any queſtion to be handled in the Church, which may ſeem to you to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29522:14"/>carry the ſtamp of novelty. Let never your determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in ſuch occurrences prevent the ſentence of our common Mother the Church, continue in the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſubmiſſion of a tractable and reſpectful Son, and beware by a private enterprize to uſurp the ſacred au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which reſides in the perſons of thoſe whom God hath appointed for the conduct of Chriſtians. In a word, believe for a certain truth that the unity of the Church ſhould be as inviolable as its verity, and that they who make a rupture amongſt its members, ought to be conſidered as the greateſt enemies thereof.</p>
                  <p>Our Religion conſiſts chiefly in two heads, to wit, the Commandments of the Law, and the Faith of the Goſpel. We cannot fully ſatisfie theſe two, but that our ſoul which is likewiſe compoſed of two parts, to wit, our Will and our Reaſon, muſt render as great obedience to the Commands of the Law, what reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and difficulty ſoever our Wills may make; as ſubmiſſion to the Faith of the Goſpel, what repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy ſoever our Reaſon may have againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe if we believe only what may have ſome conformity with our reaſon, and no more; we do greater honour to the truth that reflects from matter, than to him who is the author of matter and truth it ſelf. Indeed, Belief hath ſome preeminence above Knowledg, becauſe in knowledg the underſtanding is only enlightened by the information of the ſenſes, which is material and ſubject to miſtakes: but in Faith our ſoul draws its notions from the ſpirit of God alone, which is ſo noble an agent, that I know not but that I may be ſo bold as to ſay, that though there might be ſome errour in the direction of my Faith, yet that my intention could not be rectified by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of the object it ſelf of my Faith, which is God.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certainly true, that the more incredible the myſteries of our Faith ſeem to be, the more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29522:15"/>we pay to God in not doubting of them. Behold the obſcurity which you find in it, as a fair night wherein you have the light of the Goſpel to direct you, and the Apoſtles, Martyrs and Saints for guiding Stars, in whoſe ſteps you tread even at preſent. In a word, take it from me, my Son, that your reaſon is much more certainly your Daughter according to the ſpirit, than <hi>Iſaac</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, and that as often as you make a ſacrifice to God of it by faith, ſo often you preſent to him the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which drew down ſo many bleſſings upon that divine Patriarch,</p>
                  <p>God who is a nature altogether diſtinct from ours, deals with us by means contrary to our meaſures, and which are altogether inconceivable to us. When he applied clay, which is a matter apt to put out the eyes, to reſtore the blind mans ſight, it was to teach us that we can never well enjoy the light of the ſoul, but by putting out the light of the body. For it is not enough to know by the light of Nature that there is a God, it muſt likewiſe agree with our Faith, upon the ways whereby he communicates himſelf to us, and the ways how we ought to ſerve him.</p>
                  <p>The imployment of our Reaſon is only to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Faith as a diſcreet Handmaid, which is not yet ſo much a ſlave to it, but that it may examine the Law of God according to humane prudence, but not the Faith, to the end that the beauty of his commands and their neceſſity in the conjunctures of civil ſociety, may inſtruct us to reverence and fear him that gives us them. Can we have a better warranty of our belief than Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who teaches us to love God above all, our neighbour as our ſelf, and even to do good to him that hates and perſecutes us?</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of Libertiniſm and Miſcreancy.</head>
                  <p>I Wonder not, my Child, that thoſe who will not ſubmit to any of theſe things, have the boldneſs now adays to diſown and neglect him that by his Commandments hath enjoined them. The number of ſuch has of late ſo increaſed, that it ſeems at preſent to be the mark of the Beaſt, not to be one of them; they are called the Wits or <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> as if none had underſtanding but they, or as if it were a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of judgment not to be of their opinion. This evil is the more dangerous, that the mind infected with this poyſon, flatters it ſelf with ſome falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of Liberty, and God Almighty knows what li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: to renounce God, the common Faith, the Laws of the Land and the Prince, which are the only bleſſings that keep us in Peace, to put us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power and private Government of our moſt irreconcileable enemy, which is our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>The ſlack execution of Laws concerning a matter of that importance, ſeems to me indeed wonderful, and ſo much the more, that whoſoever makes an open rupture with God, is incapable of any other accommodation, and is from thenceforward convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of being a bad Stateſman and a bad Subject. Obſerve, my Son, the conſequences of that, the King is not my Maſter, nor I the Maſter of my Servant, nor a proprietor of his Eſtate, but by vertue of the ſtrength and ſupport which the Laws receive from Religion, it is from that alone that the publick union and ſecurity does depend.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:29522:16"/>
                  <p>A ſoul infected with ſome inſolent opinion, may well evaporate and ſend up towards Heaven ſtinking ſteams, but nature will ſooner be annihilated, than that it ſhould be ſo wholly corrupted, that the divine character can be intirely and without reverſion blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the conſcience of man: Let us not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to own our gueſt, there is nothing upon us or within us but avouches it; and though our tongue would deny, yet our heart upon the leaſt ſurpriſe convinces us of it. Strange kind of vanity! to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that men ſhould think us more wicked than it is poſſible for us to be.</p>
                  <p>I have ſeen one of the chief pillars of this fooliſh opinion appear abroad openly with applauſe, and publiſh his impiety in the head City of the kingdom, with as much confidence as if he had been ſome new Meſſiah. And more than this, which is very prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, I ſaw him after two years impriſonment eſcape out of the hands of the Judges who ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him, acquitted for want of evidence, of an impiety that had as many witneſſes as he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: whether it was that the envy of his accuſers ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, or that perhaps no body durſt evidence or give ſentence againſt a crime which they ſaw publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly connived at; or that it was judged that Atheiſm being rather a ſin of the lips and fanſie, than of the heart, deſerved no other puniſhment but its own folly.</p>
                  <p>In effect, the original of Miſcreancy proceeds but from a fooliſh preſumption that will not abide in the beaten road of common opinions. It is moſt certain, there are three kinds of ſpirits, and that thoſe of the lower rank are ſpirits of livery and attendance, which receive things according to uſe and cuſtom, without farther examination. Thoſe of the ſecond order, who are our pretended Wits, go a little farther, they tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider the effects of ſecond cauſes, their motions
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29522:16"/>and regular changes, but they conſider them only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately and divided from the whole, and not being able to riſe higher, they are forced to reſt there, and leave to them the dominion of the Univerſe: but the tranſcendent ſpirits of the higher ſphere, prying more narrowly into things, and rallying together ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate and divided cauſes, diſcover the connexion and agreement that is amongſt them, and by ſeeing all the different parts conſpire to compoſe that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal harmony, they advance to the knowledge of a ſoveraign cauſe and principle, by whoſe providence all things are governed; ſo that I think Libertiniſm makes Vanity its falſe Idol, and he that makes profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, carries rather the ſtamp of an Ignorant and Blockhead, than of a Wit: and ſo much the more that he puts out his own eyes, and robs himſelf of his greateſt light, which is the knowledg of God.</p>

                  <p>SON, As it is dangerous to aboliſh the ſentiment of a Deity by Atheiſm and Miſcreancy, ſo is it likewiſe no leſs dangerous to forge a falſe image of God by ſuperſtition, the denying of God leſſens not his greatneſs, when ſuperſtition on the other hand according to its timorouſneſs aſcribes to him an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of bad qualities, and by conſequence the wrong is leſs, to be in doubt of his being, than to do him injury. Atheiſm does not totally ſuppreſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the actions of ſenſe, it roots not out natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affections, nor the care of our reputation, as Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition doth; and though Religion be the chief agent
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29522:17"/>in all the Moral Virtues, yet are they not ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the negation of God, as they are with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.</p>
                  <p>Superſtition is a baſe and cowardly vice, to which the common people, children, women and old folks, who are all weak perſons, are moſt ſubject. It is afraid of every thing; what is paſt, what is preſent, and what is to come, keep it in a continual quaking, for fear of the vengeance of God. it is raſh and inconſiderate in its zeal, witneſs the rage of the wars occaſioned by Religion; and ſo ingenious to do it ſelf miſchief, that it makes him who ſhould be the inſtrument of its ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the executioner of its puniſhment, and the place of its refuge and protection, its ſcaffold. In a word, Superſtition is the paſſion of a ſoul dull in the works of Charity, peeviſh, diſtruſtful, ſcrupulous, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanes Religion, by placing all the duty of it in antick faces and external grimaces, as if the true worſhip of God were but foppiſh jugling, or a ſpiritual tatling.</p>
                  <p>Be nevertheleſs well adviſed, my Child, how you ſhun that imperfection, and take heed that in forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it, you fall not into another inconvenience no leſs dangerous, by committing ſome irreverence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the forms and ceremonies of antient uſe, which make a part of your Religion, leſt (as it happens often in the bodies of men) you purge not what is ſound with the corrupted humors.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. How we are to uſe our Will and Reaſon in the Service of God.</head>
                  <p>MY Son, Man cometh into the world like a new Artiſt, with his rule and compaſs, which is his reaſon and will: but that he may have the pleaſure to be in ſome ſort the maſter of his trade, God who is his chief Architect, hath left the care of ordering of both to himſelf. To order aright a compaſs, we muſt keep one leg of it faſt, and in making of its ſweep bring the other round to the ſame point where it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
                  <p>For the adjuſting of our reaſon, God ought to be the fixed point, and our life the moveable part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which makes its whole courſe round that unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able point. To know the juſtneſs of a Rule, you muſt firſt draw a ſtreight line from one point to another, and afterward another ſtreight line of equal diſtance from, and of the ſame length with the former; with theſe conditions you may aſſure your ſelf your Rule is true. My Child, if you would regulate aright your will, and make a good application of it in all the actions of life, let the firſt line that enters into its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, be your love toward God, and the ſecond your love to your neighbour.</p>
                  <p>Let this laſt be always meaſured by the former, and in due diſtance from it; for if you neglect the preſent neceſſity of your neighbour to betake your ſelf to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation or Prayer, when you think you draw near to God, you falſifie your rule and take wrong mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: and therefore the life of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> which is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29522:18"/>the pattern of a Chriſtians, is almoſt all taken up in the ſervices of his neighbour. He viſits, inſtructs, comforts, feeds, cures him, compaſſionates his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and what is moſt remarkable, it ſeems that leſt he ſhould abandon him, he prays but ſeldom to God his Father; and when he prays to him, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find in all the Scripture, that his Prayer regarded himſelf alone, but at the approach and in the agonies of his paſſion, to teach us that the hour of death breaks the ſociety of man with man, and that in this occaſion which decides the ſalvation of every one in particular, we have all enough to do in our own buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>The moſt pleaſing ſacrifice that you can offer to God, is to render the ſervice of your neighbour pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to his own: and when in the Lords Prayer he makes you ſo often repeat the words [Us] and [Ours,] take it for a leſſon to make no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt your own and neighbours concerns: He that told you, that <hi>when two or three of you ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in my name, I will be in the midſt of you,</hi> promiſes not to you the ſame bleſſing when you ſhall be alone, and therefore to obtain it, join to your own the intereſt of your neighbour in your prayer.</p>
                  <p>This is a ſtrange myſtery, that at the laſt day he is not to accuſe you of the taking of his name in vain, nor of the breach of his Commandments, he will only then tell you, <hi>When I was naked, you cloathed me not, when I was hungry, you fed me not, when I was afflicted, you comforted me not,</hi> and ſo forth. And what is the reaſon of that? becauſe that laſt line, to wit, the love of our neighbour being that which ſhould bear proportion to the firſt, which is the love of God, all the actions which depend on thy Will, will avail thee nothing to ſalvation without it.</p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:29522:18"/>
                  <p>The Lord requires but of you the ſeventh part of your life for the ſanctification of his name, nor all that neither, if the neceſſity of your neighbour crave your help. So we ſee that the moſt aſſiduous in the former, are ſuch whom the weakneſs of age, ſex, or ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of an idle and unactive life, hath rendered lazy and unfit for the offices of reciprocal charity which men owe to one another.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. Concerning Prayer. Of Private and Publick Prayers.</head>
                  <p>COnſider well how you pray in private, foraſmuch as it is an action which requires of us a clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and purging of the ſpirit, and a frame of ſoul more pure and diſengaged from the body than any other whatſoever. So we ſee that when our Saviour went about to pray, he aſcended to the Mount, that he might withdraw from the commerce of men. In a word, when a man prayeth, he ſpeaks to God; and if he be impenitent, and ſtill polluted with ſome foul deſire, he calls his Judge to be the witneſs of his crime: wherefore I adviſe you that a ſhort examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of conſcience do always go before your Prayer. If it be frequent, let it be ſhort, and like a ſpark that riſes from an inflamed heart, let it mount to heaven with ſilence and reverence, and not with thunder and noiſe like the lightning that falls down from thence.</p>
                  <p>Prayer is our union with God, whether we adore him, or beg any thing from him, if it be long, our weakneſs ſuffers it not to be without diſtraction, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29522:19"/>from the very minute that your attention ſtragles and wanders from him, againſt his own Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you take his name in vain. Your inferiour would even take it ill, if that whileſt you were a ſpeaking to him, your thoughts were taken up elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, the rays of our minds are leſs able to endure the contemplation of God by a fixed union in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than our eyes ſtedfaſtly to behold the Sun, the aſpect of both muſt only be had by ſallies and glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and therefore the form of Prayer which hath been left to us from the mouth of our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Lords Prayer, is divided into ſeven diſtinct petitions, which are ſo many ſtops and pauſes deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to us the impotency of our ſoul to unite it ſelf with him any other way than by ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>Beſide this prayer which was given us for a pattern, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did the ſame, when his own concern lay at ſtake, ſaying, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible that this cup may paſs from me;</hi> and another time, <hi>Lord, if I muſt drink it, let thy will be done:</hi> and a little after, <hi>Pardon them, God, for they know not what they do;</hi> and before he yielded up the ghoſt, <hi>Into thy hands I commit my ſpirit.</hi> All theſe things are ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reſts of the humanity of the Son of God, as if he had wanted breath to continue his prayer.</p>
                  <p>I intend not in this brevity to comprehend the publick prayers of the Church, the uſe of which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, as being of divine inſtitution, and whereof the conſort make one harmony of our voice and wills in the preſence of God; they are like ſo many ſparks which breath out of the common fire of the inflamed hearts of the faithful.</p>
                  <p>It is almoſt impoſſible to conſider the majeſty of Churches, the publick places of Aſſembly, the decent ceremonies which are there performed, the ſound of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29522:19"/>Bells, the conſort of our voices with Organs, and to ſee that the rallying of all theſe things together makes but an uniſon betwixt us and nature in the worſhip of God, without being convinced in our own conſciences, that their inſtitution is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
                  <p>Aſſure your ſelf, my Son, that all theſe things are ſo many different rivulets, which flow from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and Apoſtolick Faith, and that you ought to reverence them as you do their fountain.</p>
                  <p>If this content not yet your devotion, and that you would make a longer prayer both publickly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, wherein there may be no diſtraction; let the beginning, progreſs, and end of all the actions of your life have always a reſpect to God, and you ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly in Prayer. Every ſervant that is diligent in his maſters buſineſs, deſires tacitly his maſters fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or his reward. Conſider what will become of you, if your actions, how good ſoever they may be, reſpect any thing beſides God. Your compaſſion for the miſeries of another, which is the bud of Charity, will be no more but a natural imbecillity of your ſoul that cannot ſee him ſuffer; the mutual duties which paſs betwixt men without that reſpect, are no way profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to ſalvation. If you give that you may receive, or do one good turn to attract another, it is no more Charity, but traffick. In fine, all moral virtues are changed into dead works, if they be not quickned by the love of God.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. Concerning the Lords Prayer.</head>
                  <p>ABove all things I recommend to you that your moſt ordinary Prayer be the Lords Prayer: I leave to your diſcretion all others that are of humane inſtitution, but this I would have you often repeat. It is a ſhort inſtruction to man, which marks ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the duty and acknowledgment which he oweth to God, and the need that he hath of him, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what it doth preſcribe, he can ſay nothing to God, nor beg any thing of him but what is ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Although this Prayer be very ſimple in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yet it ſpeaks ſo fully the plenitude of its author, that (if you examine it narrowly) it contains not ſo much as one word, which is not beyond the reach of humane underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Conſider thoſe two firſt words, [Our Father.] Wherefore [Our] and not [My,] ſure you pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but to inform you that your care ſhould not be confined to your ſelf alone, and that he being our common Father, we are all his Children? Wherefore [Father] but to make you underſtand by the relation that there is betwixt Son and Father, and Father and Son, that acknowledging him to be your Father, you oblige your ſelf to him by a filial obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his paternal protection? The word [Father] is a name of good will and tenderneſs, which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf always uſed when he ſpake to God, until he was upon the Croſs, but in that place he calls God only <hi>Lord,</hi> which is a name of authority and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, inaſmuch that the name of [Father] would
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29522:20"/>on this hard occaſion have been too tender, and that he would make appear, that it was only the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Son of God which then ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>He tells you that he is in Heaven, to the end that you may ſeek him there, and that you give your ſelf no trouble to know him otherwiſe but by Faith, and becauſe his infinite Being is incomprehenſible, leſt that you ſhould propoſe to your ſelf an uncertain and undeterminate object of Adoration, he hath been pleaſed to condeſcend to your capacity, and to be worſhipped by a name whereby we ſignifie what he is, not as he is in himſelf, but according as we are able to conceive him.</p>
                  <p>Having taught you that your firſt homage and acknowledgment is due to him, he would have you next think of your own ſalvation, and above all things pray for his Kingdom, that you may antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the enjoyment of it even in this world; he ſhows you that your Will ſhould ſo fully agree with his, that you have always the ſame love and hatred as he hath: for indeed you cannot renounce your own Will, to accommodate and ſubmit your ſelf to the Will of God, but that you muſt be carried by the ſame inclination of your mover, and jointly reign with him.</p>
                  <p>Next to the reſignation of your Will, God would have you be contented here below with that food which you may moſt eaſily command, to wit, bread; leſt that anxious ſolicitude for other things may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert you from your duty; he would likewiſe have your proviſion ſtinted to one day, to comfort you in this your exile, and to give you to underſtand by this ſmall <hi>Viaticum,</hi> that your abode in this place is ſhort and uncertain; and to the end alſo that if you have more than enough, you give a ſhare and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to thoſe that are in want. Conſider that you receive them into partnerſhip, when you ſay, <hi>Give us
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29522:21"/>this day our daily bread,</hi> which is a petition that you make in common with others, if he grant you more than is ſufficient for one day, you cannot reſerve it to your ſelf alone, without robbing the indigent &amp; poor.</p>
                  <p>My Son, what follows, if you take not good heed to it, is rather a ſnare laid for you, than a prayer. Here let your prayer end, if you be a rigid creditor, or entertain any hatred or malice againſt your neighbour; if you deſire to have grace, ſhew favour: for when you ſay, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſs againſt us;</hi> if you harbour vengeance or malice in your mind, you pronounce againſt your ſelf the ſentence of condemnation. God will ſtill leſs pardon you if you mock and laugh at the imperfections of another, for ſuch as have them are neither indebted nor accountable to you.</p>
                  <p>O good God! <hi>lead us never into temptation,</hi> that is to ſay, leave us never to our ſelves in the leaſt, for we can never be abandoned to our own conduct for how little time ſoever, but that we are expoſed to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of temptations. <hi>Deliver us</hi> from that, if thou pleaſe, good Lord, and <hi>from all evil,</hi> whether active, which is ſin that kills the ſoul, or paſſive, which is pain, unleſs it be thy merciful will to furniſh us with grace to ſupport it to thy glory.</p>
                  <p>It hath been my cuſtom theſe forty years, to ſubjoin the 142. Pſalm to the Lords Prayer, it makes appear the inability of man to juſtifie himſelf in the ſight of God; mans blindneſs in the diſcovery of his ſecrets, the faintings and dryneſs of the ſoul without Gods help, and the need that it hath of his conduct. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it moſt commonly every day, until I come to the verſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt bring forth my ſoul out of tribulation:</hi> I ſtop there and never ſay the reſt. A King, ſuch as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> may invoke the wrath of God againſt his enemies, as being the enemies of his ſtate, a private man cannot do it with a good conſcience, without the permiſſion of the Church.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:29522:21"/>
                  <p>For concluſion of this firſt part, having told you, my Children, that God cannot be conceived, it is to tell you that he cannot be expreſſed; ſo that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that I who have ſo little knowledge in facred learning, can have handled the Duty of Man towards God, without falling into ſome miſtake. Theology is a ſacred Virgin, ſo rich in its natural and proper graces, that it is hard for a man who hath not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiated in its myſteries, to touch it without hurting the purity thereof, and leaving on it ſome mark of his imperfection. If by ignorance or inadvertency any word or thought have eſcaped me which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the ſacred Canons of the Church, I forthwith diſown it, and heartily ſubmit my opinions as well as my faith, to the cenſure of thoſe who are ſent by God to be the Judges thereof.</p>

                  <p>MY Child, in the firſt part of this my Will and Teſtament, where I have treated of your duty toward God, I have ſhowed you that the knowledge of him muſt go before your adoration, which is your duty towards him. In this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29522:23"/>ſecond part, where I propoſe to ſpeak of your duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your ſelf, I intend to obſerve the ſame order, judging it moſt convenient that you ſhould know what you are, before you be inſtructed of your duty towards your ſelf; to accompliſh my deſign, I think it neceſſary to trace nature ſtep by ſtep, and to eye her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways as the forerunner of my enterprize.</p>
                  <p>When I conſider her in the firſt elements of our life, I find nothing but incontinence, fainting, griping pains, and a flood of impurities which accompany your tears. It ſeems that in the other productions of Nature there is ſomewhat more happy, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the procreation of Birds and Plants. Birds bear not as we do their young in their womb, they lay and hatch their eggs in the lovelieſt ſeaſon of the year, with ſo much tranquillity and repoſe, that many times the ſame hand that robs the neſt of their young, does likewiſe ſeize the old: Their harmony and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort during that time ſufficiently proves that their birth is fortunate in reſpect of ours. Plants likewiſe ſeem to renew their life when they begin to bud, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of corrupt blood or unſavory water, a ſweet dew does moiſten and cheriſh their fruit. It is not (like us) wrapped in an impure coat, its own flowers encompaſs it, which in blowing perfume the air, and the very leaves, which are as their after-birth, ſerve them for cloathing and ornament until they are ſtript and left naked by the winter.</p>
                  <p>This advantage, my Son, which Plants ſeem to have above you, hath only been granted them for your ſake; the chief end of the production of their fruit, is that they are for your uſe, and prudent nature who deſigns them for your ſuſtenance, preſents them to you in that manner, leſt otherwiſe you might loath and reject them, do not therefore envy them.</p>
                  <p>Now if the production and birth of ſome living creatures ſeem leſs painful than your own, and that as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29522:23"/>ſoon as they are brought forth, they find cloathing at hand and their table covered, for both which you muſt labour with the ſweat of your brows, yet are they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your brethren nor your elders, they come into the world as into their native country, and their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, without pretending to any other; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is juſt that they ſhould be received as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the family: But what hurt is done to you, who are a ſtranger, and come hither as a pilgrim, to demand of you cuſtom and tole for your paſſage? The goodneſs of God who hath placed your inheritance elſewhere, thought fit to deprive you at firſt of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of this life, that ſo he might ſeparate from it your affection. Think with your ſelf, that your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous dropping into the world with your head down and feet upwards, is only to teach you that none come in this poſture into the natural place of their abode, and that here you muſt not expect yours.</p>
                  <p>Since then, my Son, you are only as a paſſenger in this life, it is your chief duty to plain the way to that whither you aſpire, and to ſeek out in this painful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage the moſt proper means to attain to it, every thing that is ſuperfluous, is but a hindrance to a traveller; it is enough for him to live and to have what is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for his journey: and becauſe the firſt deſire which diſcovers it ſelf in man as ſoon as he is born, is that of living; and the ſecond, of having every thing that he ſees. In treating of the Duty of Man towards himſelf, I ſhall begin with the meaſures that he ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in the moderation of thoſe two firſt appetites.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Concerning the moderation of the firſt appetite of man, which is that of living, where Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is handled.</head>
                  <p>IT is moſt certain, that the firſt appetite of nature which is diſcovered in us when we come into the world, is the deſire of living, which conſiſts in eating and drinking: Infancy and old age are moderate enough in this deſire, it is only young age that abuſes it, and which only upon that account ſtandeth in need of counſel and direction. And foraſmuch that in this middle age the natural ſenſes are in their force and vigour, and eſpecially the taſte, it is very hard to retain them in ſo regular a mean, but that the ſoul does often become complice with the body in that exceſs.</p>
                  <p>The exerciſes of body, heat of blood, and exemple are ſuch violent counſellors for the belly, that reaſon which is but then imperfect cannot reſiſt. In defect of that, the beſt advice, my Son, that I can give you in ſuch occaſions, is that you let the inconveniencies of gluttony be your firſt inſtruction, if you have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded yourſelf with meat, for a leſſon of moderation conſider the indiſpoſition and heavineſs of your body, your loathing and diſguſting the bad digeſtion of your ſtomach, and the vapours that ariſe from the crudities thereof, which bemiſt and darken your mind.</p>
                  <p>If you have drunk too much, conſider your eyes, mouth words, reelings, the obſtructions of your ſpirit, and how many hideous and ſhapeleſs dreams and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the vapours of wine does lodge in your brain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til that ſleep and perhaps your own excrements have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29522:24"/>buried you, then will you find all theſe things to be ſo many different documents of ſobriety; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the body is never drowned in wine without the ſhipwrack of the mind, you will faſting perceive better the uglineſs of that vice in the debauches of other men, than in your own: follow it ſtep by ſtep from the beginning to the end thereof, make the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in your ſelf, and call to mind the giddineſs, loathing and indigeſtion which the like will occaſion in you; and having done ſo, you muſt be well hardned in your ſin, if ſhame do not reclaim you.</p>
                  <p>Miſtruſt that liquor which imprints the malignity of its juice on the wood that drinks it, though it be much harder than your fleſh; the ſtock of the vine is only knobby and crooked, to inform you that the uſe of wine if you glut your ſelf therewith as it doth, may cauſe in you the ſame effects, ſhaking and reeling, fambling and ſtuttering of the tongue, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs and the gout, are the tempeſts of its vapours. Conſider this, the fuller your ſtomach and the larger your belly is, the narrower will the reach of your wit be, the more disburthened of fleſh the body is, it is the more healthful, active, vigorous and obedient to the commands of the ſoul. If nature deny, let your diet procure you this conſtitution, begin it betimes; for if the too great quantity of victuals have once ſtretched your ſoft and pliable guts, they will give you no reſt afterward until they be filled.</p>
                  <p>Though Children muſt be allowed ſufficiency of food, yet they muſt not be ſo far indulged as to let them carve for themſelves, and far leſs to provoke their appetite, or to ſolicite them to eat againſt their ſtomach; we muſt believe that nature which works freely in that age, during the ceſſation of the mouth, is elſewhere better employed in conſuming of ſome hurtful excrement.</p>

                  <p>Beſides this ſwiniſh intemperance of the Mouth, whereof I have been ſpeaking, which is never ſatisfied without being glutted, there is ſtill another more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and artificious, and that is the luxury of the Table, it is dainty and full of oſtentation, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive now adays in its preparations, that the ſight alone and ſteam of diſhes, is enough to ſatisfie the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite without touching of them; the palate ſtands in ſuſpence at the diverſity of joints and diſhes that are preſented to it, not knowing on which to reſolve. This luxury makes indeed but few drunkards, becauſe the eyes only are there for the moſt part fed, but it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten begets poverty, a more dangerous evil, and for an addition of miſery, the deriſion of him that thereby ruines himſelf.</p>
                  <p>My Son, though my table give you twice a day a leſſon of ſobriety, yet you may ſpend at Court ſome part of your life as I have done, and bring from thence no more than I, but a more dainty and delicate palate: Wherefore if Fortune call you into the publick, which is my wiſh, I adviſe you to regulate betimes your diet according to your condition, make uſe of ſuch things as may not always be in your power, with that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that you may be able to diſpenſe with them without trouble; abſtain from exceſs in them, and from too much care in hunting after them: my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is alſo, that if you ſhould come to want them, you might let them go without grief or anxiety; by doing ſo, you will in this part ſatisfie what you owe to your ſelf, which is the thing that I propoſed to my ſelf to teach you.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Concerning the moderation of the ſecond appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of man, which is the deſire of having; where Avarice and the true uſe of riches, are diſcourſed of.</head>
                  <p>AS the deſire of nouriſhment is the firſt appetite of man, the deſire of having is the ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of nature, which is almoſt born with him, and keeps him alwaies company. We ſee it in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who have no ſooner the uſe of their Arms, but that they give ſome ſign by hand or eyes, that they have a mind to all that they ſee: Whatever we give them, they carry it immediately to the mouth, all their actions then tending only to nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two firſt appetites, which are in a manner twins, are ſo rooted in man, that they ſeem to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate with him, both of them have their birth in us before the ſoul hath knowledge; wherefore the more dark and obſcure they are, the more they ſtand in need of light and conduct, and the more natural they are to us, the more ought our care and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection be, that they plant not in us bad principles. Moderation of diet gives health to the body, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the ſoul; moderation of the deſire of having, gives peace and tranquillity to both; their contraries producing contrary effects. Since it is ſo, my Son, you are obliged to purchaſe to your ſelf a good, the enjoyment or loſs of which, will cauſe the happineſs or miſery of your life. I have already ſhown you the inconveniences of intemperance in diet, I come
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29522:26"/>now to thoſe which the immoderate deſire of having may occaſion.</p>
                  <p>A wiſe Politician of the times by alluſion calls Riches the baggage of vertue, as if he would thereby ſignifie to us that they are no leſs cumberſome than neceſſary. For my part, I ſhould rather ſay that the want of riches is the greateſt incumbrance that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue can meet with; if they be heavy in reſpect of the great care that is required in purchaſing, ſpending, and preſerving of them; yet I think it ſtill more bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome to poſſeſs ſo little wealth, that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but with much difficulty ſupply the neceſſities of life.</p>
                  <p>He that is taken up in progging for an ordinary livelyhood, can hardly lay up any great ſtore of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; ſo we ſee in the Lords Prayer, that the petition of our daily bread goes before that of the forgiveneſs of ſin, and the not leading us into temptation, which is the bridling of our paſſions, wherein all moral vertue conſiſts. To ſay the truth, there may be hurt both in the one and other, but the want of riches is far more incommodious, than their exceſs cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; and our Language does properly call them goods, becauſe without them we can enjoy no worldly good.</p>
                  <p>Let us not think it a blind appetite that a Child has a deſire for every thing that it ſees, it is a preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of nature, that informs it that all things are made for its uſe, and when it wears off all that it hath, it is by another foreknowledge that all goods being common, they ought to paſs from hand to hand, and ſucceſſively eſcape our affection. It is only he that would have every thing, and keep all that acts againſt nature, whoſe blindneſs is ſo great, that he cannot learn by the vanity of his labour, that his covetouſneſs is a leaky veſſel which cannot be filled.</p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:29522:26"/>
                  <p>Obſerve, my Son, the puniſhment of his ſin, he deſires to hold all faſt, and lets all ſlip, goods which are not goods, but in the uſing of them, loſe their name and property in his hands, he robs himſelf by depriving ſociety of them, to ſpare them he renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all the pleaſures of ſenſe, for whoſe ſake men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire their poſſeſſion, and the cuſtody of an avaricious mans treaſure is ſo ſlaviſh, that one cannot tell which is the gaoler or priſoner, his treaſure or himſelf. The ſubſtance of a rich man is a wall raiſed in his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſaid the wiſe man, and conſequently being but imaginary, not very ſure; the reputation of his wealth is an outcry that ſets out his eſtate, only to expoſe it to the firſt ſeizer, and he is ſo wretched that leſt he ſhould not be rob'd, he becomes a prey to himſelf rather than fail.</p>
                  <p>Look to it, my Son, if on theſe terms you deſire to have and keep all; conſider how many advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which may be in your power, you muſt renounce for the view of one, which is impoſſible to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, inaſmuch as by filling your ſelf with riches, your thirſt will increaſe with your dropſie. I conjure you then to be wiſe in this deſire; the Poetical ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were heretofore the antient Theology, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the march of the god of riches according to the place from whence he ſets out. If <hi>Jupiter</hi> who is the god of heaven ſend him, he comes but ſlowly, like riches that are lawfully and honeſtly acquired. If he be ſent by <hi>Pluto,</hi> who is the god of hell, he comes running in diligence, to teach us, that nothing but vexation, injuſtice, oppreſſion of the weak, and a baſe and abject proſtitution of ones ſelf, can get riches haſtily and in great abundance.</p>
                  <p>To win gold, the earth muſt be digged and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, the metal drawn from thence, ſeparated from other matter, purified from its droſs, melted, refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, broken, and beaten a thouſand ways before
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29522:27"/>that it can be made into a maſs; the hardneſs of skin, the blackneſs and ſweat which the body contracts in that baſe exerciſe, ſufficiently repreſents to us the contagion and impurity of that metal. I aſſure you, my Child, you muſt ſuffer more pain and ſordid drudgeries than all theſe, to gather great riches, and when you have got them, it is to no purpoſe. Gold in the ingot is but a maſs of oſtentation and ſhow, if it be not put to uſe, how much do you think muſt it ſtill endure from the file, hammer, ſheers and wheel, before it can be made currant money?</p>
                  <p>Great Poſſeſſions without being emploied, like gold in a maſs, ſerve only for a ſhow, and to make that, how many mouths are to be fed, how many orders diſpatcht, how many accounts to be reviſed, and how much care and circumſpection muſt be had, to which a moderate deſire is not at all ſubject? To conclude, the diſtribution of riches (without the ſtamp of Charity, which is the coin of the Prince that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows them on us) cannot be lawfully performed, no more than the paſſing of coined gold, if it want the impreſſion of the Soveraign.</p>
                  <p>So that a rich man is accountable for all he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; if he make ill uſe of it, he is puniſhable as well for having hid, as for having inconſiderately ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his treaſure. Poverty which men propoſe to avoid, is the chaſtiſement of the covetous as well as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal; the one ſuffers it already by his ſparing, the other is in a fair way to it by his profuſion, his train, the luxury of his table, rich moveables, ſtately houſes: In a word, his magnificence and ſplendour are the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of his funeral pomp.</p>
                  <p>Be moderate then in the deſire of having, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious in the managing of riches; if I leave you but little, I hope your own induſtry and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God will ſupply what you want: behave your ſelf with honour in the profeſſion which your
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:29522:27"/>birth obliges you to follow; ſoon or late you will therein find the end of your life, or a ſupply of what is neceſſary to maintain it. Above all things touch not the goods of another, and eſpecially of the poor, for the rich defends his own, but the other is more expoſed to prey; take never any advantages of the neceſſities of the poor.</p>
                  <p>I enjoy the houſe where we live by a decree of Court, having asked leave of the owner to bid for it, and when I ſaw that the Creditor left him nothing, my year and days poſſeſſion being expired, I freely preſented him with a gratuity of the tenth part of my purchaſe, to the end that he might not leave his inheritance empty-handed. God and the ancient poſſeſſour are my witneſſes, that he might have ſtill been the maſter of it, if he had had no other impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment but from me. More than this, I payed that reſpect to the next in kin, not to bid for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe without his conſent, and all this without either acquaintance, particular friendſhip or relation to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them: They are ſtill alive, let them and my own conſcience give me the lie, if I ſpeak any thing but what is true.</p>
                  <p>I propoſe to you, my Son, this domeſtick example, to the end that you may never make a violent entry into another mans inheritance, and that you regard more the poor man that is undefended, than the rich; though the Laws abandon him to you, which allow us many things that charity forbids, yet abate a little of their rigour for your ſoul and conſcience ſake: conſult but that, and put your ſelf in the place of the poor, and your own ſenſe will teach you how you ought to treat him. In the Scripture, he that ſaid to the debtor that was not able to pay, <hi>Render what you ow me,</hi> was as rigorouſly puniſhed, as if he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted what was not his due. Draw from that divine fountain this fair leſſon, that your deſire ſhould not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:29522:28"/>only be moderate in matters which belong not to you, but likewiſe ſo much even in things that are your own, that you may be able to renounce them without regret when they deſtroy charity.</p>
                  <p>When I would have you thus indulgent to others, I mean not that you your ſelf ſhould be miſerable, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is juſt that your pity begin at home, your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity regards your ſelf more directly than your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; but if you have more than what you ſtand in need of, lay it out freely and chearfully for the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of others.</p>
                  <p>Lay not up before hand the revenues of many years, a years rent ought to ſuffice you, but neglect not that neither, experience tells you that the preſent lives by the laſt years crop, and that the gain of yeſterday feeds to day the workman; the providence of God would be offended, if yours were negligent; neither would I have you imagine that you owe all your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence to your ſelf; old wine grows ſowre, and the vermine conſume old corn, you will labour in vain for a new harveſt, if God be not pleaſed to give the ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Join your aſſiſtance with his in the getting of goods, and uſe them as you ought, ſpoil not their name by a bad uſage; and ſince riches are called means, let them be ſo to you, I pray, for the ſatisfaction of your own, and the neceſſities of your neighbour.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. Of the Will of a Child, that it is a rude and indigeſted reaſoning of the Soul, and how it ought to be guided with moderation.</head>
                  <p>I Come now, my Children, to treat of your Will, which I diſcover not in you, but after the two firſt appetites, whereof I have diſcourſed before: for albeit every action preſuppoſe the will of him that does it, yet that of a Child appears ſo troubled and obſcure in the deſire of feeding it ſelf, and of having all that it ſees, that I aſcribe it rather to a blind im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of nature, than a voluntary inclination. The Will is a motion of the Soul made with deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and, I think, there is not any in theſe two firſt appetites.</p>
                  <p>I perceived not, my Son, that you had a will, but in the firſt reſiſtance that you made to mine; I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it in that age as an eſſay that you reſolved to make to put your ſelf in liberty, and to enter into the firſt poſſeſſion of your ſelf, to which nature was your adviſer; the firſt man as yet innocent, and newly formed by the hand of God, did the ſame; that ſame appetite wrought in him (as in you) before his fall.</p>
                  <p>It is ſtrange, when a Child begins to go, he will have no more the help of another; when his will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to dawn, he is unwilling any more to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; as if the deſire of acting in liberty were more violent in us, than of our own ſecurity: this appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite being common to all Children, proceeds from nothing elſe but a principle of nature, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to man to be as well ſingle and individual in the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29522:29"/>functions of body and ſoul, as he is in the compoſition of his perſon.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Philip</hi> conducts the ſteps and wills of his Children <hi>Armand, Hardowin,</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> it is not one ſingle going nor ſingle Will, it is compounded of <hi>Philips</hi> and theirs, and then there is a diſſolution of the individual beings of <hi>Armand</hi> and <hi>Hardowin</hi> in what concerns their Wills; ſo it is no wonder that they make reſiſtance in obeying him, it is occaſioned by an advice of nature that would act by its own meaſures, and which imprints in every one of us a deſire of entring as ſoon as poſſibly we can into the poſſeſſion of our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>In effect, the headſtrongneſs of a Child is only a rude and groſs reaſoning of a ſoul as yet imperfect, which would betimes enjoy its rights.</p>
                  <p>My Son, learn to order your will by the fault of the firſt man; the crafty Serpent that would deceive you as it did him, is the falſe object of an apparent good, and the Woman that tempts you, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence and luſt of the eye and fleſh, the ſeat whereof is not far from the place from whence the firſt Woman was taken, nor its perſwaſion leſs preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to make you ſin, than hers was: when that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed counſellor comes out of us, we are aſleep as <hi>Adam</hi> was; for if we had our eyes open we ſhould preſently ſee the deceitfulneſs of its counſel.</p>
                  <p>You are naked in this world without the ſenſe of your nakedneſs, as he was in the delightful Garden, but ſo ſoon as you reſiſt the will of God and follow your own, your eyes begin to be opened, your curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity to know all things, your avarice which cannot be ſatisfied, your unlimited ambition, your reſtleſs luſting that skips from one deſire to another, diſcover to you a nakedneſs which you did not ſee before, you loſe all to graſp at all.</p>
                  <p>You can never be happy, my Child, but only by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:29522:29"/>the moderation of your Will. I require not of you a total renunciation of it, that internal mortification belongs only to Saints, nor that all things ſhould be indifferent to you, which is an extravagance of Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoniſm; for indeed they are not all ſo; nor that you ſhould ſubject your ſelf to the Stoical ſeverity of theſe two wild words, <hi>Suſtine, Abſtine,</hi> which have too large an extent. Abſtain only from all things that are unjuſt, and from deſiring that which is not in your power. Support all the Calamities which you cannot honeſtly ſhun, and draw upon your ſelf no new ones, and your Will ſhall be ſuch as I would have it.</p>
                  <p>God gives you not the Senſes, of Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Taſting, nor of Touching, in vain; nor likewiſe what is moſt pleaſant and ſweet in nature for their ſatisfaction: If you abuſe either of theſe bleſſings, by exceſs, or a diſdainful contempt of uſing of them, you are both ways injurious to him that makes you the Preſent. If your Table were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with good Diſhes, and your Gueſt would taſt of nothing but coarſe bread, and flat drink, he would certainly offend you. In this manner do we treat the univerſal Purveyor of the World, when we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to make uſe of thoſe excellent things which he hath prepared for us. The Senſes make the firſt try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the goodneſs of God toward men, be content to moderate the exceſs of them, without ſtifling the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of their ſenſation.</p>
                  <p>I am not the leaſt in doubt, but that there is a more perfect way than this of going to God; but that belongs only to thoſe tranſcendent ſouls, who would anticipate the enjoyment of him in the middle of their courſe. As for us, my Children, who are but of ordinary endowments, let us reſt ſatisfied with the middle and more eaſie way of advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. It is enough for us to meet him at the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:29522:30"/>end of our career, provided that in the courſe of our life, we always did behold him as our laſt end.</p>
                  <p>As I would not have you diſdainfully and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly refuſe the pleaſures which Nature does libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally preſent you with; ſo neither is it my meaning that you ſhould be low and baſe in bearing of her croſs diſpenſations; the ſame hand preſents you with good and evil, receive it therefore with the ſame tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and countenance.</p>
                  <p>The Plague that viſits you with ſickneſs, and your friends with infirmities and death; War which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the confuſion that fire and ſword does occaſion, comes attended with enmities, quarrels, ſuits of Law and Famine, which is as much as a total deprivation of all that is neceſſary for your ſubſiſtence, are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the portion and lot of Humanity, than the rods of Gods indignation. He puniſheth you with no others, but what your own hands have made; that is, your ingratitude towards him, the injury done to your neighbour, the hatred and violence that you uſe againſt him, your envy, injuſtice, avarice, and in a word, your debauchery and looſneſs; avoid theſe, and acknowledge no other evils.</p>
                  <p>Conſider rather the Plague, War and Famine, as three great flood-gates, which are now and then opened to drain the world, when the plenty of its productions cannot otherwiſe by the ordinary courſe be evacuated. So that, my Son, if you find your ſelf carried away by any of theſe terrents, or by any other ſtream that flows from thence, follow the current without complaining; reverence, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the immutable decree of Providence; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur not, nor ſtrive againſt the ſtream, nor wonder at the proceedings of deſtiny; but know that it is (as well as your ſelf) obliged to follow it's order, and to run in the channel that is appointed for it.</p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:29522:30"/>
                  <p>When any croſs accident befalls you, it is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, it comes not upon you at random by a fortuitous inconſtancy of chances which hit by gueſs. There is ſuch a neceſſary coherence and concatenation between cauſes, that like waves they puſh one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forward, though we cannot know the original cauſe of their impulſe, when nevertheleſs there is one; ſeeing the ſmalleſt effect that can happen, hath its cauſe. The more immediate may come into our knowledge by reaſon of the nearneſs that it hath to its effect: but to trace the progreſs from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upwards in order, to the fountain head, would be, my Child, a curious and ſucceſleſs enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>
                  <p>Be content then to ſubmit your ſelf to what God is pleaſed to appoint you, and to be aſſured that he who hath thought you worthy of his creating, will likewiſe vouchſafe you his conduct and preſervation. the good and had accidents of your life, carry the character of his Providence, though to you inviſible, as the loweſt and baſeſt creatures, the ſtamp of his omnipotence; and ſo much the more wonderfully, that his immenſity is contracted in that ſmall draught and repreſentation.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is that I would have you apply theſe two words, <hi>Abſtine, Suſtine,</hi> by patient ſupporting of the evils that befall you, as having their quarters with you allotted by the hand of God; thoſe bad gueſts are enough for you though you admit of no others: So that you may abſtain from what is unlawful and ſuperfluous, without depriving your ſelf of what is allowed and permitted: However I ſhould willingly adviſe you to entertain a very moderate deſire even for the things which are in your power, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.</p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:29522:31"/>
                  <p>Felicity conſiſts not in <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs,</hi> but in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that is between your deſire and enjoyment; it matters you not though both be in ſmall Volume, provided they be of equal extent. How little ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you have, if you be therewith ſatisfied, you are as full as if you deſired much, and had it, and in as great repoſe. My Child, if you have at hand a ſmall River that may quench your thirſt, ſearch not farther off for a greater which can do no more.</p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch as it is impoſſible that your Will, whoſe object is vaſt, undetermined, and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, can be totally regulated according to my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, make uſe of this rule upon all occaſions. When you have no body to conſult with about what you are to do, but your ſelf and your own Will, let the ſide to which it inclines you moſt, be always moſt ſuſpected; but above all, let not your Judgment be ſwayed by the preoccupation of your ſenſes, whoſe counſel many times goes hand in hand in the ſame crime with your luſt.</p>

                  <p>THE miſtakes of our Will, which tends natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to good, proceed only from our inability of knowing it. The turbulent paſſions of Youth, and the prejudice of an evil habit, do ſo jumble and confound the notions of real and apparent good, that reaſon that comes after, and is formed in us during that tempeſt, is not then capable to make the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them: to make that aright, we had need of the knowledge of good and evil, which is the fruit of the forbidden tree.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certain, that the real nature of things which preſent themſelves to us, is ſo hidden, that for want of knowledge of it, our ſoul is often miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their choice. When it was asked of the Sun of God, What is truth? He made no anſwer, as if he would have by his ſilence given us to underſtand, that man was not capable of that knowledge. Truth, as far as I am able to conceive it, is a conformity of the tongue with the thought, from which reſults an action which ought likewiſe to be conformed to both.</p>
                  <p>The union of theſe three things, my Son, is to you ſo neceſſary, that if there be any diſagreement amongſt them, you efface in your ſelf the Trinity of your Creator, who would have you made according to his own Image. The Divine word reſembles the power that produces it, as the action which flows
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29522:32"/>from the ſame. If you would be framed according to this divine pattern, your words muſt agree with your thoughts, and at the very inſtant your actions will receive the ſame delineation.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſaid, that Man is naturally inclined to good, and never ſets himſelf to do evil, without ſome repugnancy in his ſoul. When he propoſes to himſelf the doing of any action, the reflection that he makes thereon, is an internal ſpeech which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes him to the execution of it if good, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to divert him therefrom if it be bad. If it be good, his conſent agreeing with his judgment, he performs it publickly, and never conceals it: But if it be bad, acting then contrary to his internal ſpeech, which is the council of his Conſcience, he is aſhamed of his action, does it ſecretly, and when it is done, either diſguiſes it or diſowns it.</p>
                  <p>For example, if you meet any one that is going to Church, to viſit the ſick, or to comfort one that is in affliction, and if you ask him whither he is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he will freely tell you; his thought and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will be conform to his action: but if he be going to any place of debauchery, or to commit theft, murther or adultery, you ſhall never hear him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his deſign, he will put it in execution under the protection of ſome by-place, or dark night, as if he were aſhamed to be the complice of an action wherein he can hardly agree with himſelf.</p>
                  <p>So that, my Son, you ſee that there can never be a perfect concordance betwixt our thought and free conſent, which is an internal ſpeech, but in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of a good action. This harmony, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a man faithful to himſelf, and inwardly true, frames him after the image of God, as on the other hand the diſcord of our conſcience with our will, makes a lie and a lyar, which is the ſpawn of the devil.</p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:29522:32"/>
                  <p>It is ſtrange! there is nothing that wounds ſo much the honour of a Gentleman, as to give him the lye, although he reproach himſelf often with it, without thinking that he does ſo. Child, every time that he cheats, that he foiſts in one thing for another, that he diſſembles, flatters himſelf or others in their imperfections, or that there is the leaſt diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between his words and thoughts, ſo often is he a lyar.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing that vexes us ſo much, nor raiſes more our blood, than the preſence of one that hath deceived us. The trouble and diſpleaſure which we have frequently with our ſelves, proceeds, it may be, only from this, that our ſeducer is always with us. Your Conſcience knows it, if it call to you from within and tell you that you are an Impoſtor, be not angry if a voice reproach you ſo from without, bear the cenſure and ſhame patiently, or otherwiſe ſtrive to amend.</p>
                  <p>My deareſt Children, Sons and Daughters, if ye deſire that I ſhould be ſatisfied with you, I charge you above all things that ye be true, and though the eldeſt of you be not as yet ſeven years old compleat, ye are already capable of the veracity that I deſire in you; at preſent it conſiſts only in a Yea and a Nay, conform to your knowledge: it is far more eaſie for you to form a real notion of a thing that is, than a falſe image of what hath no being; truth may be expreſſed without art and ſtudy, but a lye hath need of both.</p>
                  <p>The Gentry of our Nation hath better underſtood the uglineſs of his Vice than any other Country whatſoever, judging a lye to be the greateſt and moſt inſupportable affront, not to be repaired but by blood. True Nobility having its riſe from vertue, one cannot give a Gentleman a lye, and not forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with reproach him that he degenerates, and that he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:29522:33"/>thereby forfeits his quality. A liar to ſatisfie his vanity, or to pleaſe the perſon whom he flatters, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, or fears, is guilty of felony againſt God who ſees all things, in whoſe preſence he ſpeaks a falſhood. It is very certain that we ought juſtly to reſent that reproach, provided we have truth on our ſide; but if we tell a lye indeed, we boldly maintain to God, Man, and our own Conſcience, a falſity which it internally diſowns. Think therefore, my Son, that you cannot ſufficiently abhor a crime which plunges you in the abyſs of this confuſion.</p>
                  <p>Though ſome of our actions be indifferent, yet (with the good leave of our Caſuiſts) there is not any the leaſt lye that can be ſo, though even it were offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. For by that, the faithfulneſs of commerce betwixt God and man, and betwixt man and man, is broken. Your tongue is the inſtrument of your ſoul, which is the thing alone that you have ſtill in your own power.</p>
                  <p>Make uſe of it, my Friends, according to the intent of nature that beſtows it on you, in expreſſing your thoughts with ſincerity, until that a more ripe and advanced age may render you fit for the other fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of life, which are Studies and Exerciſes.</p>

                  <p>AS the Body and Soul, my Children, are form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bred both together, ſo likewiſe after the ſame method ſhould we endeavour to accompliſh and perfect them in company. And therefore it is my opinion (though the common practice be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) that ye follow your Exerciſes and Studies at one and the ſame time; to the end that by an alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate progreſs and regreſs from your ſtudies to your exerciſes, and from your exerciſes to your ſtudies, you may with more profit and leſs tediouſneſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your courſe, than when you are forced with one breath to run the career of either.</p>
                  <p>Nature gives us this leſſon in all her productions; when ſhe forms a flower, its ſtalk, bud, bloſſom, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and ſmell, advance jointly with ſo equal a pace, that it is her laſt ſtroke alone which finiſheth all its parts.</p>
                  <p>My Child, the body and the ſoul are two twins whereof you are compoſed; if you neglect the one, to take care only of the other, you are the ſtepfather of that which you forſake, they crave both your care at one and the ſame time: when by exerciſes you have rendred your body healthful, well diſpoſed and nimble, it is all in vain, your buſineſs is but half done, without the concourſe of the good qualities of the ſoul, to wit, of ſciences and vertues which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on ſtudy.</p>
                  <p>The fable of the Poets tells us, that the Tutor of <hi>Achilles</hi> was half-man and half-horſe, to hint to us
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29522:34"/>that Studies and Exerciſes ſhould be learnt jointly: it calls him likewiſe the Son of <hi>Eſculapius</hi> the God of Medicine, becauſe the indiſpoſition of body, and ſickneſſes, are the obſtacles and hindrances in the progreſs of an accompliſhed life. Occaſion is bald, and Fortune inconſtant, they are both to be taught by a cunning catch, or not at all, and therefore a moment of time loſt by ſickneſs may ſnatch them out of our hands.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. Of Exerciſes. Of Riding, Dancing, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing: and of the agility of Body and Hand.</head>
                  <p>APply your ſelves then, my Children, to thoſe exerciſes which render the body healthful, ſtrong and nimble, and at the ſame time neglect not your Studies; but ye muſt paſs from the one to the other ſo regularly, that the change may ſeem rather the divertiſement of your work, than the alteration of employment.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt Exerciſes, Running, Wreſtling and Jumping, preſerve a good diſpoſition of body, and are of great uſe for the Wars: but having often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the moſt part of thoſe who have excelled in theſe three, become gouty, and grow old before their time; <hi>Armand,</hi> my eldeſt Son, I adviſe you not to uſe them, you have too hot and boiling a temper to keep moderation in ſuch exerciſes, you are ſo exceſſive in every thing you do, that I am afraid leſt by ſpending and diſſipating much of your ſpirits in bodily action, you may have no more left for the functions of the ſoul: if their reſtleſneſs, which never
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29522:34"/>allows you repoſe; relent not a little, as you grow in age, the fountain of them being unable to ſupply their activity, it may be that I may have the grief to ſurvive you according to the courſe of Nature, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I be ſix and fifty years older than you. Take heed to it, my Son, and refrain thoſe violent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, or be very moderate in them. As to your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe natural conſtitution is more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate than yours, I allow them all that I forbid you.</p>
                  <p>I am rather of the mind that you learn to ride the great Horſe well. By this exerciſe a man faſhions the carriage of the body, and at the ſame time the Horſe is managed. In it a man is taught how to ſit, carry his body, hold his legs, his foot, and his hand, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the bridle or ſwitch, to make the Horſe obey whatever he is bid do. And in all theſe things, there muſt be a great deal of patience, whereof your reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs temper hath much need.</p>
                  <p>Be ſatisfied to acquire a competent skill in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, without applying your ſelf to it over much; to excel in it one muſt know the nature and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar temper of every horſe, and it is to be feared that by too much familiarity with them, as they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſomewhat of the man, ſo by the ſame reaſon we may contract a little of the beaſt.</p>
                  <p>Slight not Dancing, which is a motion of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that adjuſts it ſelf with meaſure to the riſing, mean, or falling of the voice or inſtrument that is played on. There is no man of what condition ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, nor any nation whether of the new or old world, that loves not Dancing. Diſturb not that univerſal conſent by a ſingular and private repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy; our new Reformers who condemn it, ſhow as little reaſon in this as in the reſt, for leaving the common cadence. By Dancing you will acquire a graceful carriage, provided you ſubject not your ſelf
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29522:35"/>too much to the rule of Art. A maſter teaches you your ſteps, but the air, port and liberty of body muſt come from your ſelf: As there is ſomething rude and barbarous in ſlighting this exerciſe, there is likewiſe ſomewhat too ſoft and effeminate in ſtriving to excel in it.</p>
                  <p>A woman is to know no more of this, than what is conſiſtent with modeſty, nor a man more than the decorum of his condition will admit of, leſt that otherwiſe he may transfer unto his feet the care that he ought to have of his head. Dancing is to be learned, to ſatisfie with ſome order the impulſes of blood and ſpirits which move and ſtir in a young bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: but as ſoon as ever they are ſetled and a calm in our veins and arteries, we muſt bid adieu to the Ball.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another exerciſe which you cannot be without, and that is the handling of the Sword. You carry it not as an ornament, it is rather cumberſome; nor for the ſecurity of your perſon, ſince you live under the protection of the Laws. The Gentry car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it, as being the inſtrument of their profeſſion, which is to be always ready for the ſervice of the Prince. You are covered with no other arms but this, which is rather an offenſive than defenſive wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, to inſtruct you that you are more obliged to ſhed the blood of your Princes enemies, than to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your own. You carry it in time of War for the ſervice of the State, and in time of Peace to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh you from the common people, and that they may alſo reſpect you as being armed for their defence. If you make uſe of it againſt them, unleſs it be on your own defence, you prophane it, and deſerve to have it taken from you, as having defiled it with baſe or with innocent blood.</p>
                  <p>Learn to uſe it for the maintaining of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, for though you live under the protection of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:29522:35"/>Laws, yet the ſame Laws, if one tranſgreſs them by doing you an injury, ſhould have in vain allowed you to carry it on the ſide of your heart, if it was their meaning to deprive you of the liberty of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to repel an injury. The lawful ground of uſing it, is a blow with the fiſt, threatning, injurious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, accuſing one of a diſhonourable crime, the upbraiding of one with a ſhameful imperfection, and the lye: But I ſtill underſtand it with this condition, that if you be accuſed of a vice whereof you are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or receive the lye for a thing which is indeed falſe, that both theſe reproaches be to you rather an occaſion of amendment than revenge: in this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter bend your force againſt your ſelf.</p>
                  <p>When you are obliged to take Sword in hand, make uſe of that which hangs by your ſide, a long Tuck is only for Hectors or Robbers. If you exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe your ſelf with the foil, (though it be in the Fencing School it ſelf, or at home in your houſe) let it be with doors ſhut, and your particular friends: take not up the Fluret in all ſorts of places, that is, the vanity of a Fencing-maſter. Be not too vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nor too frequent in that exerciſe; and above all things when you are upon a Journey, beware that foils may never be ſeen to make a part of your equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, as I have often ſeen at Court: let the maſter of that equipage pardon me, if he pleaſe; but he gives me ground to ſuſpect that he ſtood in greater need of a breaſt-plate. My Son, be a little more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral of your fleſh, and venture your body, rather than ſuch precaution ſhould give occaſion to make you ſuſpected of fear, or that you have in your head ſome deſign of a combat.</p>
                  <p>As concerning Hunting, which is permitted to great men and to the Gentry, I dare not adviſe you that paſtime, becauſe it contains in it ſome hidden poyſon; for though it render a man active, vigilant
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29522:36"/>and laborious, yet there is a certain venom mingled with that exerciſe which bewitches and brutifies him that is too much addicted to it. If it appear to be chaſt, vertuous and innocent, like the Goddeſs who is the Patroneſs thereof, yet its effect is barren, and brings forth no more than ſhe. He that purſues it as paſſionately as that famous hunter of Antiquity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes himſelf to the ſame misfortune; that having hunted much, finds at laſt the idol of his pleaſure to be a very naked thing, grows brutiſh, and becomes himſelf at laſt like the beaſt that he hunts, a prey to his own dogs.</p>
                  <p>Hunting is of great uſe in time of Peace, foraſmuch as it keeps the Gentry in breath, and affords an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent diverſion to ſpirits that are impatient of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. In time of War it is quite contrary, for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to private pleaſure the ſervice which is due to the Prince and publick. Obſerve, my Son, in fine, that excepting great <hi>Cyrus,</hi> there was never any great hunter a great Conqueror.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, my Children, what I have to ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Exerciſes, I give you this advice more, that you never meddle with any but ſuch as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to you health, or become your quality, even though you might excel in others. Renounce all ſorts of dangerous leaps, jugling tricks, and ſlights of hand; let Juglers and Gypſies enjoy their own trade.</p>
                  <p>All theſe things are like the works of— where there is much dexterity, but very little uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. None but the rabble are taken or concern themſelves with them; nevertheleſs I condemn them not as ſuperfluous, ſince it is not altogether unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the Government that fools ſhould divert fools. Neither do I fobid you to ſee ſome time all the <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-fair Shows, I rather adviſe you to it, and to reaſon from thence, that ſeeing the body and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29522:36"/>mind of man is capable of a great many idle ſubtilties which ſeem impoſſible, if he excel not likewiſe in things that are neceſſary, it is only for want of pains and good application.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. That the firſt knowledge of Man ſhould be that of himſelf. That he ought to know the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the place of his abode, which is the World and Arithmetick.</head>
                  <p>NOW as concerning your Studies, I think that man ought to be to himſelf the firſt ſubject of his enquiry, and that he cannot handſomly deſire to be knowing abroad, and ignorant at home. Indeed if we deſire to pry into the knowledge of things that are without us, how low ſoever they may be, we ſhall find theſe that are below, equally unknown to us as thoſe that are above us.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall as little underſtand the nature of Hyſſop, as of the Cedar; or of an Head-worm, which is but an excrement of our skin, as of an Angel, which is a middle Being betwixt God and Man. This firſt enquiry into our ſelves, ought to be ſo natural, that I cannot enough wonder that men have ſo much eſteemed that famous Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> in <hi>Delphos, Noſce te ipſum,</hi> Know thy ſelf; ſeeing that there is no man, how weak ſoever, that puts not often to himſelf this queſtion, (What am I?)</p>
                  <p>So that Man might be better defined, an enquiring Creature, than a rational Creature. If he were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally rational, all his actions would ſpring from a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29522:37"/>wiſe conſultation of mind, which is that we call Reaſon: but in reſpect that the inclination of his Will is oftner hurried by an external impulſe of ſenſe, that dwells only on ſhows and appearances, than by an internal tryal and examination of mind, which makes the difference between real, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, good; let all antiquity pardon me if it pleaſe, that I agree not with in it this, that Man is a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creature. He may become ſo, but that he can be ſo without ſtudy, and exerting acts of Reaſon, is what I cannot conceive. Reaſon is rather a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity proper to Man, than eſſential to him alone. Let us call the underſtanding of an Elephant, Horſe or Dog, what we pleaſe, it is not without reflection, which is a kind of reaſoning, no more than our own.</p>
                  <p>If theſe three Creatures had not had ſome ſpark of our underſtanding, we could never have become ſo familiar together, nor have been employed reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively (as we are) in the ſervice of one another. I do notwithſtanding confeſs, that their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is far ſhort of ours, and ſo obſcure, that it is not to be diſcovered but upon a near view; which gives us ground, that we may not own them as our brethren, to call it rather an Inſtinct, than Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning.</p>
                  <p>Probably there are none but Man capable of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but that he is always rational, is againſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: The eſſential difference which agrees with him alone, and diſtinguiſhes him from all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world, is to be Enquiring. As there is none but he that doubts, it belongs only to him alſo to deſire to know. Every Man, young or old, good or wicked, poor or rich, ignorant or learned; in a word, of what condition ſoever he be, is hourly and continually an enquirer.</p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:29522:37"/>
                  <p>My Son, before you came into the world, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained nine months ſhut up in a Den, living only the life of a Vegetable: but ſo ſoon as you became capable of the Senſitive, you your ſelf put your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the poſſeſſion of their rights, by breaking the priſon of the Womb.</p>
                  <p>Child, render to your Soul the ſame good Office; its Functions for ſome time lie ſtupified under the imperfection of matter to which it is coupled: As ſoon as you finding make the leaſt effort, to get out; be not wanting to its aſſiſtance. At firſt your knowledge will be muddy and confuſed, like the knowledge of thoſe who are ſtun'd by a great fall. After your fall into this world with your head downward, and your lying benum'd nine months in the womb of your Mother, and as many years in the darkneſs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; when you begin to come out of that primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Syncope, put to your ſelf that queſtion, as they when they come out of their trance, What am I? or, Where am I?</p>
                  <p>Aſſiſt the firſt informations of your Soul by the miniſtry of your Senſes. When you ſee here at home, that my Dogs ſerve to watch and guard my Houſe, my Horſes to carry me, my Oxen to labour my ground, my Sheep and Poultry to feed and cloath me, what can you think, but that he for whoſe uſe all theſe things are made, hath ſome preeminence above them? By this you ſee that Man (which you are) is the moſt perfect Creature which you know.</p>
                  <p>Conſider in this place, my Son, the wonderful Oeconomy of the Creator of the world, who to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all emulation and envy, amongſt the infinite number of his Creatures, hath not thought fit, that any one being, ſhould know another better than it ſelf. Plants are ſatisfied with the Vegetative Soul, the Senſitive being unknown to them. Inſects ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other notion of perfection but of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29522:38"/>to themſelves, are without doubt deſtituted of the knowledge of what they want, as other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bear without repining the knowledge which we have, whereof they have no Idea.</p>
                  <p>Upon the ſame ground we may ſay, that there is not ſo much as one man who does envy the nature of Angels, of the excellence of which we conceive no notion, but under the image of a form unknown; nor that there is ſo much as one man that in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and relations would make a total and intire change with another; becauſe that neither of the two wiſhes can be made without deſiring the anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation of our Kind, or individual Being, to which Nature cannot conſent. This progreſs mounts from Kind to Kind, and from Creature to Creature, up to God, to the end that every thing ſhould ſo much the more cloſely be knit to him, that it is pleaſantly deceived by this flattering illuſion, that it is it ſelf alone which is the favorite of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
                  <p>Son, having diſcovered what you are, let us now ſee where you are. If you reſt ſatisfied to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here below more accompliſh'd than Man, you have matter of humiliation, in reſpect that the place of his abode, is the common habitation of all ſorts of Creatures, and the loweſt Story of the world.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch-as it is, ſince it is appointed to him for his reſidence, and he to have the uſe of it, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant of its parts and apartments, without ſlighting the Architect that beſtows on him the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the ſame. And therefore I would have you, before all things, learn Coſmography: A Map and a Sphere will furniſh you with a draught of the Heavens and the Earth in a ſmall compaſs. And ſince there is not a corner of the world which hath not been diſcovered by men, within theſe hundred or ſixſcore years paſt, there is not a part thereof
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29522:38"/>which you may not every day review in your mind, and go ſo far, till there remain no farther to be gone.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge of the Ancients comes ſhort of ours in this point. In the firſt place they knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of the New World, which is greater than the Old, and of the Old they have allowed but two parts to be habitable, the other three they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſert, by reaſon of cold, or the exceſs of heat; which, in my opinion, was no very good way of Philoſophiſing, to render Nature idle, and unactive in ſo great an extent of Countries.</p>
                  <p>It had been much more probable to have believed, (as it hath been ſince found out) that Nature, which makes nothing in vain, had accommodated the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Man to the temper of the Climate where he was to live: That under the Poles ſhe had conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his skin, (which is the effect of cold) and ſo rendred his Pores leſs tranſpirable, that he might ſuffer leſs inconvenience from cold; and that even for an additional ſupply, ſhe had made cold Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries fruitful in Furs. And as to hot Countries, where day and night are alike in length, and where the Returns and Viciſſitudes of Seaſons are almoſt imperceptible, there was great appearance, that the courſe of Mans life ſhould have been there more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and healthful, and conſequently, that in ſuch Climates Inhabitants ſhould not be wanting.</p>
                  <p>And indeed there is no part of the world, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, where men live longer, and in better health, than under the torrid Zone. It is there alone, where men feel but little of the Curſe of Original ſin; the Earth, without being laboured, yielding to them of its own accord all that is neceſſary for Food and Rayment.</p>
                  <p>My Son, exerciſe your Studies in this Science, which is of great uſe; provided you make the right application of it. By conſidering the ſmall extent of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29522:39"/>the Earth and Water, which make up but one ſingle Globe, and which is no more than a Point in reſpect of Heaven, you may make a reflexion on the vaſtneſs of the Univerſe, which will raiſe your thoughts to a Metaphyſical contemplation of the immenſity of God, who is the Author of it; as on the contrary, the ſmall Globe which you poſſeſs of this Point of Earth, in regard of the whole, will teach you a Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſtian and Moral Humility, by making you underſtand the ſmallneſs of your portion.</p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe very neceſſary for the underſtanding of Natural and Civil Hiſtory, in reſpect that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral diviſion of the world by Limits, and the latitude of the ſeveral Parts, and the ſubdiviſion thereof into Principalities, according to the Confines, Rivers, chief Cities, Manners and Government of every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral State, are ſo many Retreats and different Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where the Memory, which is naturally fluid, fixes and reſts, and where it takes breath again to form to it ſelf an order and method, without which it can never but confuſedly diſpoſe of its Magazine and Store.</p>
                  <p>Having got ſome knowledge of the place of your abode, and where you live, which is the Earth, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the courſe of your life is made up of hours, days, nights, weeks, months, and years, the unequal mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of which depend on the revolutions of the Sun, and the diverſe faces and appearances of the Moon; I would adviſe you to ſtudy the particular Theory of both theſe Luminaries: Further than that, inform your ſelf but little of what elſe is above you.</p>
                  <p>Leave to the Curious the Reveries that go current in the world concerning the extent of the Heavens, the matter whereof they are compoſed, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, motion, and the influences of Coeleſtial Bodies on ours; all which things have given Being to a Science; the vanity of which appears in this, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:29522:39"/>a good Aſtronomer, or Aſtrologer, ſeldom makes a good Stateſman. The wonders of Heaven are not manifeſt to Man, but when he looks down upon the Earth: The light and power which emanates from that Divine ſource, being unperceptible to the eye and mind of Man, but by the reflexion which we ſee thereof here below amongſt our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Arithmetick is abſolutely neceſſary for the practice of Geography, and for that part of the Sphere, which I would have you know: Learn it at the ſame time you learn the others, even to its Fractions; leave the reſt, which are the broken and figurative num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to ſuch as deſire to excel in Algebra, which is a Science too ſubtile and abſtracted for the commerce of humane ſociety.</p>
                  <p>And for as much as we all have naturally an origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Arithmetick, which is formed in us by the ſight of the plurality of ſeveral individuals which preſent themſelves to us to be conſidered without confuſion, and that Coſmography is rendered palpable and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the eye, by the Anatomy which is made on the Globe of the parts of the World, I propoſe them to you as the firſt Elements of your knowledge; for your inſtruction in which, I follow Nature as much as I can, as my chief guide.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. That Hiſtory informs Man of the tranſactions of the World, and that it is neceſſary to know it.</head>
                  <p>IN purſuance of this order, it is not enough for you, my Child, to know who you are, nor what is the place of your abode; you muſt alſo have ſome knowledge of that which paſſeth in this place; for that purpoſe, Nature hath thought fit that Memory ſhould be firſt of the three faculties of the Soul which manifeſts it ſelf in Man, that it might be the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of his firſt informations; to it Hiſtory does properly belong; which is divided into two Heads, the one is Natural, which is a general collection of the particular works of Nature; and the other Civil, which is another collection of all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar acts of Men.</p>
                  <p>So that the true ſubject matter of Hiſtory taken in its ſource and principles, is only individuals and particular things, from which the Memory draws its firſt knowledges. My Son, exerciſe your ſelf in both: But I would have you lay Chronology and Coſmography, which are two dependances on na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Hiſtory, as the baſis and foundation of Civil: They will acquaint your memory with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Time and Place, without which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that it can retain any thing in order.</p>
                  <p>Natural Hiſtory regards the actions of Nature, and the Civil, the actions of Men; from the one is drawn a Natural and Phyſical Reaſon, and from the other a Politick Judgment: And ſeeing that you
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:29522:40"/>are to live with men, it is my opinion, that you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply your ſelf firſt to this laſt Study, and reſerve the other for your retreat, and for the latter ſeaſon of your life.</p>
                  <p>Though Hiſtory be of much worth, as being the guardian of the reputation of illuſtrious men, and of notable examples which have happened before our times, yet I find it, and particularly our modern Hiſtory ſo defective, that inſtead of preſenting to us a true relation of things as they are, or have been, it is only the Gazet of them, where there is nothing more faithfully recorded than the trifles, and the matters of ſmall conſequence.</p>
                  <p>In effect, when a man would make it his buſineſs to trace backward the time paſt, which now is no more: To examine the motions of time, which was not as yet our own: To expoſe to view the natural inclinations of thoſe with whom we have had no converſe or correſpondence: To give ſentence upon the ſuſpenſe and irreſolution of a Council to which we have not been called, to dive into the ſecret of a Prince whoſe confident one hath not been, and to draw ſuch a Picture of theſe and all other things which have been unknown to us, as may ſatisfie the Spectator, and him that is on the Stage, is a thing altogether impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding of this, my Child, I would have you read Hiſtory with all its imperfections; for though it be defective in its Circumſtances, it is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid in the bulk, in that it lays open publick actions, brings back the image of paſt ages, and turns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us the inſide of men and affairs, to ſubmit them to our Judgment. Memoirs, Letters, publick Records, Chronicles, Lives, particular Relations, Annals, and Journals, are ſo many different Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, from whence are taken the examples which ſeve for a ground-work to Humane Prudence. All
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:29522:41"/>theſe things are a connexion of what is paſt with the preſent; whereof the iſſue and ſucceſs of the one, is a direction to the other.</p>
                  <p>Above all, apply your ſelf to the reading of the Lives of illuſtrious men, and propoſe to your ſelf ſome one for your imitation. The Lives of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men, which have ſome ſingle perſon for ſubject; in the texture of which there is a mixture of great matters with ſmall, of ſleight things with matters of weight, and of private actions with publick concerns, diſcover is man a Wart as well as an Ulcer, and may furniſh to one a Model of Life, provided that there be ſome proportion in quality and condition between the Original and the Copy. A Prince muſt make choice of a Prince for his example, and a Subject of a Subject, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe their meaſures will either be too ſhort, or too long.</p>
                  <p>As to thoſe great Lives, which ſeem to be beyond imitation, to admire them we muſt look upon them at diſtance as upon Coloſſes, leſt that ſeeing them near at hand, we may perceive them to be nothing but a caſt piece, or temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mortar; and ſo we ſee that they never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be known of any in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but by the means of their own prepoſſeſſed Domeſticks.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh we had in writing the Particulars of the Lives of the Duke of <hi>Weimar,</hi> and of the Mareſchals of <hi>Guebriant,</hi> and <hi>Gaſſion.</hi> The firſt is a brave Pattern for a Prince ſtript of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and the two other for a Gentleman who deſigns to raiſe his Family; though the laſt two have not been on the faireſt place of the Stage as the former, yet they have been as conſpicuous. The courſe of theſe three Lives, which have had no other end but Virtue to raiſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:29522:41"/>them to what they were, is an illuſtrious car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer which would preſent a lovely ſpectacle. I ſpeak nothing of the Living; for beſides that they may ſtill fall into eſcapes, their modeſty, it may be, or their ſelf-love might be offended at my Judgment.</p>
                  <p>The Life of the Chevalier <hi>Wayard,</hi> is, in my opinion, one of the moſt lovely Lives which I have ever read, and the true pattern to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman: This was the Chevalier without fear, and without reproach, and who was ſo equally valiant and good, that one cannot tell in which of theſe two Virtues he hath moſt excelled. My Son, I will have his Life to be the firſt Hiſtory that you read, and the firſt that you give me an account of; ſtrive to imitate him as much as you can; you cannot but write well after ſo fair a Copy. If you cannot reach his valour, which is without example; be faithful to your Prince, and courteous as he was.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X. Of fabulous Hiſtory, and of Romance.</head>
                  <p>BEſide the true, there is alſo a fabulous Hiſtory, which is that of Romance; the reading of which I do not forbid you. A Romance is nothing but a Hiſtory made at pleaſure, wherein the mind of Man gives full reins to his imagination, to form to it ſelf an image of perfection, to which the power of Man cannot attain, which is a certain mark of the immortality of the Soul, when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more perfect in its notions, than it can be in action. Indeed, the moſt pompous things, the moſt accompliſhed order, and the leaſt expected va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, is that which pleaſes us moſt.</p>
                  <p>True Hiſtory repreſents to us only things as they are, with all their faults; their events depend more on Fortune than Reaſon, and the narration becomes very often tedious, becauſe it gives account of no extraordinary ſucceſs; when on the contrary every thing in a Romance is great, there Virtues and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are extream, and always recorded according to the meaſure of merit. A thouſand rare and unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen Adventures there, ſurpriſe the Reader, and keep him always in breath, in expectation of ſome other novelty which may prove ſtill more wonderful. In fine, the Soul elevates it ſelf by this reading, and it comes often to paſs, the being inſtructed by the excellent qualities of ſome imaginary Hero, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in effect ſome real impreſſion of them; or ſome horrour of Vice, from the borrowed ſhape of the villanous.</p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:29522:42"/>
                  <p>I believe, this was the reaſon, why <hi>Alexander</hi> the great allotted that rich Cabinet of <hi>Darius</hi> for the Books of <hi>Homer,</hi> whether that he had a mind by that action to make ſome acknowledgment to him who had aſſiſted to his breeding, by the example of the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Hero's of his <hi>Iliads;</hi> or that he thought it juſt to give a ſhare of the booty of his Conqueſts to him that had ſhaped him his firſt deſign in the Expedition of <hi>Troy.</hi> It is almoſt impoſſible to read a good Romance without feeling in our ſelves an averſion from vice, or our deſires touched with the emulation of the brave actions which we read therein.</p>
                  <p>It is certainly true, that the morality which made the firſt impreſſion on my hear, was that which I read in the <hi>Amades,</hi> where I found vice always pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, virtue rewarded, the promiſe inviolable, and valour in the higheſt pitch that it can riſe to: And therefore I cannot forbid you the reading there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But for my Daughters, if they will take my word, they ſhould refrain the reading of all Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and this above all others, forfear they may learn what is not fit for them to know. In my opinion, the moſt dangerous Romance of all, is <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> which by the variety of many amorous Hiſtories, woven all in the ſame ſtrain, ſecretly kindles in young hearts that natural and ſweet paſſion, which hath its train laid in the ſpirits and blood; and though there be it that work, diſcreet and wiſe Counſels to prevent the taking fire, yet that hot and fiery Age, which is more capable of burning than Reaſon, will not at all hear them: So that I think that Book only fit to be read at an after ſeaſon, when theſe wanton flames are extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Such Romances as begin with the birth of their Hero's, the progreſs of whoſe lives interwoven with pretty Adventures being traced in order to the end, are thoſe wherein I find greateſt inſtruction. I look
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:29522:43"/>upon them as on a perfect body, whereof at one only glace we ſee all the beauties placed in their order.</p>
                  <p>As to ſuch Romances which begin with ſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of the Life of their Hero, which ſerves for the ground-work of the whole invention, being too ſubtile, they affect me leſs than the others; becauſe their gracefulneſs appears only in confuſion, and the mind is always obliged to be upon the ſcout to rally together the ſcattered pieces which make up the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, as if the Author intended to go ſnips with his Hero, in the attention of his Reader for the finding out of his order and method.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Philoſophers have repreſented to us Heroical Virtues in efforts and duties, which ſurpaſs the force of Man, that they might give him an aim, and advance them to the outmoſt confines of the power of Nature. Romances have done the ſame more ingeniouſly than Philoſophers, in that they have propoſed them to us in a ſubject endowed with them; and by conſequence they take better with our imagination under that laſt ſhape, which is in ſome manner material, than under the former, which is meerly natural.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certain, that the Idea of theſe brave, though feigned Preſentations, is able to inſtil into great Souls ſuch a Principle of emulation, that it is probable that ſome part of the extraordinary actions which have been performed in the Wars, have drawn from this Principle the boldneſs of their execution.</p>
                  <p>It may not without reaſon, be thought ſtrange, that I have handled ſeriouſly ſo frivolous a matter, and that I have made it an Article of my Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Romances, may Son, are an infirmity of the times; it hath been mine, and it may be perhaps thine; though the ſubject be vain, yet it cannot miſs of a good effect, if one can but ſoberly and judiciouſly peruſe it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XI. Of the different ends of Studies, according to the diverſity of Spirits. That it is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that Kings ſhould be learned.</head>
                  <p>HItherto, my Children, by the reading of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory to which I adviſe you, and Romances which I forbid you not, I have only ſet a task to your memory and imagination, which are the two weakeſt faculties of the Soul. It remains now that I ſhould entertain you with what may be uſeful to the forming of your Judgment, which are your other Studies, in the uſe whereof every one propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to himſelf a different end.</p>
                  <p>Some there are who content themſelves with a ſlight tincture of learning, and eſpecially with ſome skill in the Poets, (which they call Humanity) and are well ſatisfied with their pains, if they can but gain ſome eſteem in the private converſation of thoſe they meet. No Learning can be called Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, unleſs it be good; nor good, unleſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to a more ſolid uſe than the lazineſs of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active life.</p>
                  <p>Beſide, what perfection ſoever one may acquire it that kind of knowledge being but ſuperficial; inſtead of real eſteem, it produceth but ordinarily a vain eccho of fame, which anſwers no longer than the converſation laſts.</p>
                  <p>There are others who employ all their Studies about the quaintneſs and elegancy of diction, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſpeech or writing, and never heed the weight of Reaſons which the matter whereof they treat does require. Words, which ſhould repreſent to us
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29522:44"/>the real notion of things, notwithſtanding of what ornament and dreſs they may have, are no more but air and illuſion, if the ſtrength of reaſon give them not ſolidity, and a body. Beware of that gingling harmony, as of a ſnare which you lay, or is laid for you to catch the Judgment by the ear.</p>
                  <p>Whether you ſpeak of write, covet no other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction but what is moſt proper and ſignificant to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the notions of your mind. The diverſity of faces proceeds only from the diverſity of ſpirits, and the difference of ſtile from the difference of temper and humour.</p>
                  <p>A dull man will be ſlow and heavy, a crafty man will have cunning fetches, a babler will be diffuſed and tedious, a hudling ſhuffler confuſed, a deceiver ambiguous, it is the only frank and honeſt man that will be clear and near in his words. Let your ſtile then, in ſpeaking or writing, have no other end but to repreſent in the moſt genuine manner you can, the real image of the notions of your mind. if ſo you do, beſides that you will accuſtom your ſelf to be candid and true, by ſetting your ſelf out by word and writing to be what you are, you will without Art and Study inſenſibly become elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
                  <p>There are others who ſtudy, that they may fit and accommodate to buſineſs what they have learnt, and that is the ſcience of the Law and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for although thoſe men who are meer Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, have ſome ſufficiency in the diſpatch of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Judgment exact enough in ordinary matters, nevertheleſs, when any queſtion of State of great importance, comes to be diſcuſſed, as a League or Alliance betwixt two Crowns, a Rupture or Treaty of Peace betwixt them, it is moſt certain, that thoſe who have ſtudied, having by the means of learning acquired a more univerſal knowledge,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:29522:44"/>do penetrate further, and are more judicious in ſuch affairs, than ſuch who have only the ordinary Job-trot of State. However, before they be called to that, it is abſolutely neceſſary that experience have recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the precepts of the School, and the Court their uſe and application: the circumſtances which do u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually attend great affairs, not permitting that one can judge of them meerly by the rules of art. Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfects nature, and experience learning; the former makes the Scholar, and the latter the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch as the more weighty affairs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern great men directly, and the meaner only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, I think there are none ſo much obliged to be learned and knowing, as Kings, witneſs the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſucceſs of our arms and counſels, which partly proceeds from that lovely knowledg of letters, wherewith our Princes of the Blood; our chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Generals, are endued.</p>
                  <p>Upon this ſubject, the Queen at preſent ſhews us in the education of the King, an extraordinary trace of prudence, having contrary to ancient cuſtom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from his Majeſty, all young perſons, to the end that the government and wiſe erudition of thoſe eminent and diſcreet men, to whom the care and overſight of his breeding hath been committed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disburthened of that incumbrance, might be more free in the direction of his manners. Good and evil inſinuate themſelves into man only by the eye and ear.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two gates being well guarded in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Prince, and nothing childiſh appearing before him, but what may be uſeful to give him ſome good inſtruction, we ſhall ſee his judgment by little and little rectified before the ordinary ſeaſon, and his prudence as his majority anticipate that of his Subject. Experience hath often taught us, that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:29522:45"/>it is a dangerous piece of policy to withhold from young Princes any of the knowledges which they are capable to receive; ſoon or late their mind as their body comes out of pupillage: if then they are ſenſible that all the notion which they ought to have, have been ſincerely wrought in them, their ſenſe is turned into gratitude; and on the contrary, into indignation, if they perceive that there has been any deſign to ſtifle and offuſcate their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>In effect arms and letters are ſo linked together, that the Goddeſs of the one is the Goddeſs of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo that there was never any great Conqueror but who hath been learned, witneſs <hi>Cyrus, Alexander, Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Charlemain,</hi> becauſe that of neceſſity the actions of the mind, which proceed from knowledg, muſt go before the actions of the heart, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt only in execution; and that clemency towards the ſubdued, a yoke more eaſie than their former, and new and better Laws, which are the effects of ſcience, are wont to be the moſt victorious arms of a Conqueror.</p>
                  <p>The Progreſs of a rude and ignorant man, let him be never ſo ſtout, goes not far, witneſs the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries of <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> which had <hi>Rome</hi> alone for their ſtage; or if it goes far, it is but like a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind driven by a giddy and irregular impulſe, which breaks and ſcatters it ſelf in its courſe, and by its diſſipation leaves no other mark of it ſelf, but a ſtench of ſulphur and nitre, and the deſolation of the places where it hath paſt, witneſs the irruption of the <hi>Goths</hi> into <hi>Italy.</hi> Not only all great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors have been learned but we may alſo obſerve from time to time, that the moſt learned ages have been the moſt warlike: let <hi>France</hi> be an inſtance, which was never more learned, nor more victorious than it is at preſent. May it not be, that as the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:29522:45"/>of body and mind are for moſt part of the ſame age: ſo alſo in the politick body, the glory of arms and of letters ſhould always have the ſame ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>How excellent ſoever notwithſtanding Letters are, yet they teach not of themſelves their right uſe and employment. We may ſay of them in general, that they are an inſtrument for every kind of work, and that Prudence to make uſe of them is a ſcience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them all, which is only acquired by a long and judicious experience in the application of them. And therefore it is that we ſee in a great many men of learning, who, not knowing how to imploy their talent, are very ignorant in the actions of life and ſociety; for though the reading of Hiſtory may make a man provident and foreſeeing, of Poets pleaſing and agreeable, the Mathematicks ingenious, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick eloquent, Logick ſubtile, Natural Philoſophy ſpeculative, and Ethicks and Politicks ſociable: All theſe faculties nevertheleſs are but ſtupid and uſeleſs, if they be not imployed with judgment; the right and lawful application of them depends more on an original faculty and oeconomy that is born with us, than on the light which themſelves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:29522:46"/>and of our Neighbour. Child, if your will propoſe to it ſelf never to do any thing contrary to theſe two points, your virtue, without much art, will be compleat. The Morality of the ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers was almoſt all in words, and ſo contentious and jangling, that they would never agree among themſelves about the chief good, which is the object of the will: they have divided and ſubdivided vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue into ſo many parts, that its beauty is no more diſcernable, by reaſon of the many wounds and cuts that have been given it. Let us baniſh from our mind that multiplicity of virtues; there is but only one that is to ſay, <hi>Charity,</hi> which is the love of God and our Neighbour; all the reſt ſpring from this Fountain.</p>
                  <p>It is very conſiderable, that the ancient Morality hath conceived virtue under a name ſingular, and that it would not find a word proper enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it in its full extent. For want of that it hath been forced to divide it into four principal heads, and again to ſubdivide the four principal by a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altern diviſion, which inſtead of one hath produced us a ſwarm of virtues: that perhaps hath been the reaſon that for want of a notion that reunites the eſſence of all that is called Virtue, under one ſingle Idea, the inclination of ancient Ages hath not been ſo rapid towards the love of it, in reſpect that they never conſidered it but in the particulars, and by a beam reflected only from ſome good action.</p>
                  <p>For example, if a man was patient and void of fear, they called that Fortitude; if his manners were well regulated, Temperance; if he was equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, Juſtice; and if the conduct of his life was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and diſcreet, that they called Prudence.</p>
                  <p>In effect virtue is quite another thing, it's name is ſingular, in reſpect that its true eſſence proceeding from a ſimple and ſingle being, bears the ſtamp of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:29522:46"/>the unity of its principle. To ſpeak properly, there is no virtue but in God, mans is but a ſtream deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from that fountain. Every action of God, in what we can conceive of it, is only love towards his creatures, and man being made after his Image, cannot preſerve that divine reſemblance, unleſs his actions have the ſame end.</p>
                  <p>So that, my Children, there is no other virtue but that which ſhapes us after that divine pattern, and which unites us with him by a common bond of love, which is Charity: without it, that which we commonly call Virtue, is but the image and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture thereof. Ancient morality could not (as the Chriſtian hath) find a proper name for it, becauſe it knew not the true ſource from whence it ſprings.</p>
                  <p>Without that the love of our Neighbour is but meer good-will, or rather a weakneſs of ſpirit, that cannot ſee our like ſuffer without compaſſion; as I have obſerved before, it is but a dead work, if the love of God quicken it not. Fortitude, which fears nothing, and ſuffers patiently pain, and all the croſs and troubleſome accidents of life, is a faculty whoſe acts are ſavage and contrary to the tenderneſs of man; nevertheleſs it becomes a pleaſant and eaſie virtue, ſo ſoon as the love of God hath perſwaded us that all theſe things are ſent by him, and that there is nothing terrible, nor inſupportable in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but Sin, which deſtroys that love.</p>
                  <p>Temperance is a barren virtue, and inſipid in its moderation, if it be not ſeaſoned by the love of God: It is altogether likewiſe impoſſible that Juſtice can find the centre of its equipoiſe, nor that Prudence can be ſufficiently diſintereſſed in its conduct, if they receive not a juſt temper from the ſame principle. So that it ſeems the moral virtues of the Ancients have but only been ſimple diſpoſitions to good, and that they deſerve not the name of Virtue, unleſs
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:29522:47"/>Charity ſtamp them with that character: they all conſiſt in a determined mediocrity; Charity on the contrary never appears excellent but in overflowing, as the Hiſtory of Martyrs ſufficiently teſtifies: it ſeems to our eyes a piece of humane folly, becauſe the union that it makes betwixt God and man, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impoſſible by ordinary means.</p>
                  <p>The wiſe Politicians of paſt times have, in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, a more clear and diſtinct knowledg of this than the ancient Philoſophers; they have had ſome ſhadow of the notion which we have of Chriſtian Charity, in reducing virtue to the duty of the love of ones Countrey and Religion. As concerning Religion, though their object was wrong, yet their intention was good, and conform to ours. And as to the love of their Countrey, though it reſpected only their fellow-Citizens, yet it carried ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of our Charity, and was only defective in its extent.</p>
                  <p>Children, the Ten Commandments of the Law are all reduced to this, that we love God above all things, and our Neighbour as our ſelf. Ile tell you once more, that the practice of this Commandment is called Charity, which is a virtue which alone com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all Chriſtian morality, and which far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes the morality of the Schools. In the firſt place there never was any Philoſophy, Sect, nor Religion, that hath had greater regard to the publick good, and leſs to private intereſt, that God by the means of This demonſtrates to us, that God by the means of that virtue would imprint in man, as he hath in all nature, a more violent appetite to preſerve the whole, than any one part thereof; and make known to us, that that Law of nature to which all created beings do obey, and the Law of Chriſtianity which alone conſpires in this deſire, have been preſented to us by the ſame hand. When that Law commands
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:29522:47"/>us to love our enemies, and to do good to thoſe that perſecute us: foraſmuch as they who hate and perſecute us, are many in number, and that we are alone to ſuffer their hatred, and bear with their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections; it would have our private intereſt give place to the concerns of the greater number of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, who are our perſecutors, and that we ſhould pray that God would pardon them.</p>
                  <p>If we have the patience to examine the Chriſtian Doctrin in its original, though its Author be only known to us by faith, yet ſo great is the conformity of its principles with nature, that the Divinity of the Author muſt viſibly diſcover it ſelf to us. There is nothing more conſonant to nature, than to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg a firſt principle, acknowledging him, to adore and worſhip him, to unite our ſelves with him by love, becauſe we depend on him, to admit of no other Deitie but him; not to prophane and abuſe the majeſty of his Name, to give him a part of the time which he hath made, that we may reſt as he did, and contemplate with him the wonders of his works.</p>
                  <p>Now as to what concerns our ſelves: it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to nature that man ſhould be a meaſure to man. If you deſire that your Son ſhould honour you, honour your Father: if you be afraid that one kill you, defile your Marriage-bed, bear falſe witneſs againſt you, rob you, or deſign you the leaſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nature condemns you, and your own conſcience pronounceth the ſentence, if your heart and hands preſerve not the ſame innocence for another that you deſire for your ſelf: Tooth for tooth, and eye for eye, is a rude and rigorous Law.</p>
                  <p>If any one become cruel, muſt I be ſo alſo? it is far more humane to be indulgent to him; when he deprives me of an eye, he acts againſt nature, and I according to it, when I leave him both his. God
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:29522:48"/>hath indeed ſhewed an act of goodneſs which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove nature, in becoming man, but being incarnate, he hath done according to nature, in devoting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the ſalvation of all mankind: the part ſhould naturally conſent to its own annihilation for the preſervation of the whole.</p>
                  <p>My deareſt Children, it is my advice that ye ſearch for no other morality in your ſtudies, but the practice of this virtue. The Scripture calls it the bond of perfection, becauſe without it all other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are defective; by the means of this alone (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be the fixed point and centre, about which your thoughts, words, and deeds turn, and that ye, have a conſtant and unſhaken reſolution, to eye no other end but what it propoſeth) you will find your ſelves inſenſibly and without ſtudy poſſeſſed of all vertues: By doing ſo you will form and faſhion your ſouls after the manner and progreſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rather than Art; ſince the works of Art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their perfection by degrees one part after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                  <p>A Lapidary with one ſtroke cuts not all the points and faces of a Diamond, whilſt he is about the firſt the reſt remain rough and rude: but when Nature caſts any of it's productions into the mould, as a plant or flower, all its parts have at the ſame inſtant an uniform progreſs. If you ſtudy to acquire vertues by habit, and ſucceſſively one after another, you will find that when you labour for Fortitude, you will advance but flowly towards Prudence. When the Soul exerciſeth the habit of one vertue, it grows negligent in the practice of another; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the other hand, when we once propoſe to our ſelves to act nothing contrary to the love of God, or the love of our Neighbour, by means of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, our mind will be ready of it ſelf to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the acts of whatſoever vertue that end enjoyns
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:29522:48"/>us, as if it were natural to it. But foraſmuch as we cannot but with difficulty attain to that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let us now conſider what are the vices that may be able to hinder it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIII. Of the vices that ſpring from Self-love, which is contrary to the love of God, and of our Neighbour. And in the firſt place of Pride.</head>
                  <p>AS the love of God and our Neighbour is he foundation of all virtues; ſo is ſelf-love the ſource of many imperfections, whereof Pride is the firſt: That was the ſin of the firſt men, and the firſt of Angels; the one having had the preſumption to equal the knowledg of God, and the other his power. If the Man and the Angel newly created by the hand of God, have not had ſtrength to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the internal worm of ſelf-love, how can you defend your ſelf from it, who are but the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the clay of <hi>Adam,</hi> and art always beſet by the ſame Angel, whoſe ſelf-love ſet him upon his rebellion. This example ought to humble you, my Child, and nevertheleſs it is from this old leaven that the height of your ſwelling proceeds.</p>
                  <p>The happineſs of the firſt man, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the chief of the Angels before their fall, ſhew us that pride is a haughty plant, which grows not but in the beſt ground. If you be fortunate, and eſteemed of amongſt men, be the more upon your guard, and ſuffer not that what is good in you, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce with it that weed which is able to choak it.</p>
                  <p>The wiſe man conſiders a poor man that is proud, as a thing contrary to nature: we may ſee the ſame
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:29522:49"/>of a Dunce, and man of no merit, ſeeing that vanity ſprings from confidence, and that there is nothing ſo ſuſpicious, and ſo diſtruſtful of it ſelf as an ignorant: notwithſtanding we ſee ſometimes the ignorant proud, and the poor arrogant. As for the ignorant, it may be it is, becauſe that man being naturally progreſſive, the Dunce may have the ſame deſire to force himſelf forward as well as the wiſe, and that perceiving the ſtock of his ſufficiency to be but ſmall, he would enlarge it by his opinion.</p>
                  <p>As concerning him who is indigent, and yet arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and proud in his power, he muſt ſtill feel ſome ſtrength and vigour in his ſoul, and ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource that bears him up in ſpight of his heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, without that inward ſupport the pride of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry infortunate man would be but ſmall. To ſay the truth, boldneſs without fortune and merit, is but an Embrio that never comes to perfection, or if it do, it pines away like an Infant, that hath neither Mother nor breaſt to feed it.</p>
                  <p>How imperfect ſoever that appetite in man to raiſe himſelf above what he is, be, yet I can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that makes me ſo diſtinctly conceive the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, that we have with the Creator of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, as the vain efforts which are diſcovered in all things created, to put themſelves as forward as they can towards the perfection of their principle; and though there be a certain term that limits their greateſt extent, yet when they attain to that, the deſign of riſing higher, turns to a deſire of preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and ſeeing they cannot do that but for a ſhort time, they leave in their ſeed or ſlips the bud of the eternity with they have had from God.</p>
                  <p>I return to Pride, which is ſo much the more dangerous, that it attacks the nobleſt part of man. Avarice is wholly earthly; Love hath its ſeat in the liver; Anger and hatred in the bilious humours: but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:29522:49"/>Preſumption lodges it ſelf in that part of the brain which it finds emptieſt, and that is the Imagination, which nevertheleſs it would but very little infect, if men would have patience to conſider the matter whereof this phantome is compoſed: for indeed whereof is it that man can be proud? Is it of his birth? in ſight of the majeſty, highneſs, and nobility of his blood, he is ſtill the Son of a man, and perhaps of a very imperfect creature: Is it of his beauty? that is but an effect of the harmony of the qualities of his firſt conformation, the agreement of which hath made the lovely conjunction of the parts whereof he is compoſed, to which he hath contributed nothing of his own, but rude and ſhapeleſs matter.</p>
                  <p>I cannot be for his riches, for if he want the leaſt thing, and if his deſire be not intirely ſatisfied, from that very inſtant he is poor. And leſs ſtill for his Places and Offices. Dignities rather confound and jumble together men of worth, with perſons of no merit, than diſtinguiſh them. And ſo it is a kind of diſgrace for a Man of Honour, to be put in the balance with the Villain. Can it be for his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? learning indeed, which fills the brain with a confuſion of different and indigeſted notions, which it heaps one upon another, may well occaſion a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; but knowledge which examins all things, and which lets nothing paſs for true, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering it in all its appearance, is humble, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us ſee our weakneſs and imperfection in every thing, diſcovers to us the vanities and emptineſs of our preſumption.</p>
                  <p>Vanity, Child, is formed very often of the ſcum of young blood; moderate therefore betimes the vapours of yours. Fruits that burſt before they be ripe are never good to eat. Experience likewiſe teaches us that trees which are graffed near the ground, bear better and fairer fruit than thoſe that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:29522:50"/>are graffed upon the top of the ſtocks, there branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es only ſpreading above, according to the depth of their roots under ground; which is a leſſon of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to teach us, that our virtues have onely their worth and excellence from the lowneſs of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</p>
                  <p>The ſole of your feet which touches the ground, is the only part which bears and ſupports your body; your ſoul can leſs ſtand upright, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any good action, if your humility be not a ſtay and foundation to it. The humility which I deſire of you is not to kiſs the earth, nor the feet of the poor, that defiles the mouth, and cleanſes not much the ſoul; nor that you ſhould eſteem every man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove your ſelf: order requires that you ſhould keep your rank. It is in this ſenſe that I would have you humble, to wit, if there be any thing that is good in you, that you acknowledg it to be the gift of God alone, and that there is nothing your own but your faults and vices.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIV. Of ſenſual Love.</head>
                  <p>THe ſecond imperfection which ſeems to me to ſprout from Self-love, is our Senſual Love, which we name (moſt improperly) Love; ſeeing the word Love is proper only to God alone. Love in its eſſence is nothing elſe but a moſt perfect union of the thing that loves with the thing loved, which union cannot be naturally and in order, but betwixt the effect and its cauſe, and the Creature and its Creator: If you break that union with your origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to make it more ſtrict elſewhere, it is a ſpurious and unlawful union which you contract.</p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:29522:50"/>
                  <p>So that, My Child, when your love forſakes God to reflect upon your ſelf, that vain complacency is the Mother of your pride. If it likewiſe quite him to make an unlawful reflexion upon another, your affection which is then ſenſual, deſerves no more from thenceforth the name of Love. In fine we may ſay of that paſſion, that it takes to it ſelf its name, according to the different reſpects, or the predominancy of the two parts that compoſe us. If the ſoul be hurried away by the body, it is Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, if ſhe be the miſtriſs, and have the command, it is Love.</p>
                  <p>It is a wonder very ſtrange, that the heatheniſh Theology, that is, the Poetical fictions, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, can ſo well agree about the things which are attributed to love, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the contrariety that there is betwixt ſenſual and divine love, it ſeems that to attract on us the divine love, we muſt hate all the ſame quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are aſcribed to the ſenſual.</p>
                  <p>The Fable repreſents to us ſenſual love under the ſhape of a Child, naked and blind, with wings to his ſhoulders, a Bow in one hand, and a Torch in the other: A Child, becauſe that paſſion ſutes well with none but young folks, and that infancy is a ſign of the want of judgment: Naked, becauſe it ſtrips to the ſhirt thoſe that are addicted to it, and never procures any good: Blind, becauſe it puts out the eye of conduct, and that it is impoſſible to ſpie the imperfections of the thing that is loved: With wings at his back, becauſe it is unconſtant and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive: A Bow in one hand and a Torch in the other, to ſignifie to us that Incontinence is nothing but fire and ſword.</p>
                  <p>All theſe conditions are alſo neceſſary to procure divine Love. The mouth of our Saviour hath told us, that to come to him we muſt become like little
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29522:51"/>children, his example does likewiſe inſtruct us that we muſt be naked, even to the caſting off and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of our own will; and his doctrin teacheth us, that we ought blindly to captivate our minds to the obedience of faith, that the wings of hope ſhould bear us up, and that the fire of charity ſhould never be quenched in us.</p>
                  <p>My Child, the Fable would have Love to be blind, to give you to underſtand that his arms will never ſingle you out of the croud ſo as to wound you, if you your ſelf run not upon the point of them. Stand a little off, and make uſe of the Torch of that blind Boy, to let you ſee his inconſiderateneſs in his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, his ſhame in his nakedneſs, and the wrong aims that he takes in his blindneſs. Though the preſent age furniſhes us with examples enough in this kind, yet to ſpare the honour of the living, let us make uſe of the moſt ancient of all, which is that of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conſider this Judg of three Goddeſſes, who for a flower already pluckt, renounces the plenty of all things, and the glory of Arms and Sciences, of which he had the choice; nor was the Miſtreſs that was offered to him, either a Virgin, to ſhew us that virginity ought not to be the prey of a foul deſire. Obſerve, how that to commit that unlucky rape, it behoved him to violate the moſt ſacred right of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, which was that of Hoſpitality; and that during a ten years Siege, whereof he was the cauſe; he never appeared for the defence of his Countrey, nor in the Counſel, nor in Arms, but once, when he was overcome. Judg by this, that where that paſſion rules, faith ceaſeth, and ſtrength and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence loſe their action, as if they were bound by ſome ſecret charm.</p>
                  <p>We muſt be blinder yet than that falſe Deity, to call it, as we commonly do, good Fortune, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh a deſire that is foul in its deſign, diſloyal
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:29522:51"/>in its addreſſes, painful in its purſuit, dangerous in its execution, and whoſe end is often accompanied with ruin, diſtaſte, and ſhame. That paſſion hath ſo much the more need of counſel, that it hath its neſt and ſeat in the blood, and that it begins to kindle in the ſeaſon when that is moſt boyling. So we ſee it is the moſt ordinary ſubject of the Stage, which are eſtabliſhed in the Government, as much for the inſtruction as the divertiſement of the Spectators.</p>
                  <p>It is not my intention, my Child, here to put you out of conceit with Ladies, nor that you ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void them as a Quickſand which threatens you with inevitable ſhipwrack; that counſel would be too rude and barbarous: inſtead of taking you off from them, (ſeeing the ſoul is capable of love, before the body be of debauchery) I ſhould rather adviſe you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take your ſelf betimes to ſome fair and lovely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that is wiſe, diſcreet, and ſomewhat more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than you, and that you ſhould endeavour by all means, and do all you can to gain her eſteem. To deſerve that you muſt have a good grace, be diſcreet, dextrous, knowing, valiant, and ſociable. Do not you think that the deſire to become agreeable to a wiſe and beautiful Miſtreſs, ſhould not be a moſt faithful Counſellor for the acquiring of all theſe good qualities? ſo long as to pleaſe her, you ſhall exerciſe your ſelf in theſe things, the ſeaſon of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery will inſenſibly paſs away, and the perſon whom you have ſerved, conſidering you then as the work of her own hands, will love you accordingly. Then will you be ſenſible that the union of two lovely ſouls together, which is contracted by virtue, without the aſſiſtance of the body, hath ſomewhat in it far more ſweet and pleaſing, than if it had been more groſs and material. The grace of love never well preſerve their natural ſincerity, but by the firſt two ſenſes, which are Seeing the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29522:52"/>the laſt, which I dare not name, corrupts the fruit of it, if the Law which allows it, do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve its purity.</p>
                  <p>It is not that I would have you ſerve the Miſtreſs that I am ſpeaking of, with a purpoſe to marry her, your meaſures would be too near for a deſign which ought to be at greater diſtance: but it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he, who as yet being very young, could place his firſt affection on ſome wiſe female Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, who finding her ſelf obliged by the firſt fruits of our heart, ſhould give us to underſtand that all our pains and courtſhip is but labour in vain, and that we can have no ſhare in her eſteem, unleſs we deſerve it by virtue. I confeſs to you, my Son, that in ſuch a caſe, if the imperfection of the ſtuff we are made of can admit of any amendment, ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice would prove more uſeful to us to make men of honour, than any other whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>I ſay nothing to you of that brutiſh appetite, whoſe impetuoſity comes from the lees of the blood, it deſerves neither directly nor indirectly the name of Love. That you may have in horror that filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, conſider only the places of that infamous proſtitution; what their ſlavery is, what is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the evils that are there contracted, what ſtench and ſymptomes they have, how difficult the cure is, and how obſtinate the contagion; and I am aſſured, that having in your mind a lively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of that viſible Hell, you will need no other documents to guard you from it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XV. Of Hatred.</head>
                  <p>HAtred is a bad ſprout, that ſprings from ſelf-love: for though virtuous perſons have a natural averſion from the wicked, yet is it much more violent towards one who hath wounded the love that we have for our ſelves, than to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enemy; and is raiſed in us for the evil that men wiſh, or do to us. If the diſorder that a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſon cauſeth in us, did only terminate in a care to guard our ſelves from him, as from a hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creature, the wound that we receive would never rankle, which is of the nature of thoſe hurts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the conſent with other parts affected is more dangerous than the wound it ſelf. Indeed hatred is only a malignant vapour which without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion makes a circulation from the heart to the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and from the imagination to the heart, and which diſquiets us day and night, ſo long as he that is the cauſe of it is in quiet. Since it is ſo, we muſt kill, if it be poſſible, that internal worm of the ſoul, and not give our enemy the joy to beget it in us, and far leſs the ſatisfaction to ſee it gnaw and torment us.</p>
                  <p>We can have but three kinds of enemies, they are either more powerful than we, or our equals, or inferiours. If one greater than your ſelf hate you, and you ſlight his hatred, your contempt, being in a manner the annihilation of his action, you get the better of him, and put him under you. If he be your equal, you muſt imploy in that occaſion your prudence, for where forces are equal, the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and skilful commonly carry the day. Stand
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:29522:53"/>upon your guard, and skilfully avoid ſuch things as may ſtir up your own or his hatred: but if he be your inferiour, make uſe of your ſtrength to diſarm him, that is to ſay, to take from him all means whereby he may hurt you. Pluck out only the Serpents teeth, and leave him ſo.</p>
                  <p>Child, when one offers you any cauſe of hatred, I ſhould be glad that your reſentment did terminate in a horrour of the injuſtice that is done to you, without reaching the perſon from whence it comes. He deſerves pity more than you, for he breaks the bands of nature, which oblige man to be humane to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man; do not you likewiſe break them, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him, otherwiſe you will add to the evil active of the injury that is done to you, the evil paſſive of thy hatred, which will be evil upon evil. A dog is ſatisfied to bite the ſtone that is thrown at him, without fleeing at him that threw it, ſuffer not a dog to be more humane than you.</p>
                  <p>The biting of hatred is like the ſtinging of a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, to cure which it muſt be cruſhed like the Scorpion upon the wound that it hath made. In a word carry not about with you that enemy in your boſom, forget the injury, or deſpiſe it, or if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome more violent remedy, haſten to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute what your honour may adviſe you, for your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, to the end that you may with all poſſible expedition diflodge from your heart ſo troubleſome a gueſt.</p>
                  <p>There is but one only caſe where hatred ſeems to be allowed, and that is when ſome wicked and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal perſon hates you, and that you have evident proofs of his hatred and malice: in that caſe it is very hard to ſeparate the ſinner from his ſin, and not to hate both.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVI. Of Anger.</head>
                  <p>THere is ſtill another enemy that lodgeth in the heart of man, which is not ſo laſting as hatred, and is notwithſtanding more dangerous than it, by reaſon of it's violence, and that is, Anger. Children, it is my own fault, it will be yours, it is the vice of all ages, ſexes, and conditions, without any excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is no difference amongſt us but only of more and leſs: all the other imperfections of the ſoul, have a certain particular object, without which the ſinfulneſs of their action ceaſeth.</p>
                  <p>Avarice hath riches for it's leaven; hatred, an injury received; envy, impatience at anothers proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie; gluttony, the ſatisfaction of the belly and palat: Without that bait the poyſon of all theſe vices would have no more force than the vennom of a benummed Serpent. It is not ſo with anger, all things from the greateſt to the leaſt are fewel to it's fire. A broken glaſs, a falſe report, a careleſs look, the ſuſpition of a ſlight, an unlucky chance at play—which are but trifles, will cauſe as great a tumult in the brain of a cholerick perſon, as all the greateſt ſtorms of humane life.</p>
                  <p>I cannot conceive from whence ſo unconſiderate a vehemency as that of anger can proceed, unleſs it be that the ſubject that cauſes it, makes a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal reverberation from the memory to the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from the imagination to the memory, without ever penetrating unto the reaſonable part of the ſoul, and that by this colliſion our fire is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; for if the vanity of the matter that tranſports us out of our ſelves: could undergo the tryal of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:29522:54"/>the name of God who beholds our follies, would not be blaſphemed; our hair, at leaſt mine, would ſtill have remained on the head; no palpitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart, ſuffocation of lungs, inflammation of eyes, froth on the mouth, ſtuttering of the tongue, nor any frantick and convulſive motion in all the parts of body and ſoul, would be excited in us. All theſe things are ſo many ſymptoms of choler and ſo many enemies which ſtill wage war againſt me, of the victory of which, provided that ye had a ſhare in it, my children, I proteſt to you, that I ſhould have more joy to ſee us all erect a trophy in our ſouls, than of all other conqueſts which we can poſſibly obtain.</p>
                  <p>To ſay the truth, my friends, as concerning my ſelf there is no hopes of amendment: my faults be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as old as my ſelf, and making but one and the ſame ſubſtance with me, it is impoſſible now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them and leave the perſon that ſupports them. So that I cannot engage with you in this conflict, nor aſſiſt you, but like thoſe who ſound the charge and never enter the battel. This enemy notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is not invincible, provided that he be fought on the frontiers, and reſiſted at it's firſt tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuary charge before that it ſeize us: then we ſhall perceive that it is of the nature of ſprights, whoſe firſt aſpect is terrible; and that in effect it hath neither body nor ſinews no more than they, when one hath courage to abide it.</p>
                  <p>This is a ſign of it's weakneſs, that women, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, old people, and the ſick who are all infirm perſons, are moſt ſubject to that paſſion. A man of courage is never overtaken with it, unleſs by his care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, and therefore to overcome him, it muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſurpriſe him o the weakeſt ſide: The covetous man by loſſes, or decay of trade and gain the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious by a repulſe, the vain man by a ſlight, the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:29522:54"/>voluptuous by the deprivation of his pleaſures, and ſo of others.</p>
                  <p>The nature of anger, me thinks, hath been rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well expreſſed, by calling it an impotency of the ſoul; for from whence could have proceeded the ſcourging of the ſea, the threatnings againſt Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> the challenging of <hi>Neptune,</hi> the diſplacing of the gods from their ranks, the ceſſation of their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, the denying of them, the rending and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of houſhold furniture, cloaths, and of his own fleſh, but from an extream impotency of a weak ſoul? And in ſo much that men laugh at all theſe follies, inſtead of having of them in horrour, that indulgence does ſo maintain them, that there have been known a hundred braggadocios of anger, who are indeed milder than they ſeem to be, introduced into the good will of great men by the very means which ought to have baniſhed them from it.</p>
                  <p>Though my temper be more ſanguin than chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, yet ill luck at play, and impatience in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, hath occaſioned in me ſuch troubleſome fits in the paroxyſm of that feaver, that if you cut not off from yours, and eſpecially, you my eldeſt ſon, who are the moſt boyling of all the reſt, theſe two breaſts of wormwood, I mean Play, and the ſame Impatience that I have had, I am very much afraid that after my example that malady do not make in my family a part of mine inheritance.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing that better diſcovers to us the uglineſs of that vice, than to ſee a man in that agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſuffer in ſome ſort an entire annihilation of what he was before, by the change that it is wrought upon him. He cannot be known by the indications and marks of his mind, the firſt lineaments of it are gone, rage hath effaced them; and yet leſs by the form of his countenance, the convulſions which he ſuffers, not permitting him to retain ſo much as one
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29522:55"/>trait of his ordinary feature.</p>
                  <p>It hath been perhaps the prudence of nature, that this vice being more prompt and active than the reſt, it ſhould not be able (as they) to hide it's defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and ſinfulneſs in the depth of matter, and that by appearing outwardly, it ſhould let us ſee in the repreſentation of it's uglineſs, the image of other vices it's brethren, whoſe venom is more hid, to work in us thereby a general averſion from all. Would to God that we could behold our ſelves with a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome look in a glaſs, whilſt our ſpirit is boyling, and that the real external and internal picture of our tempeſt could be conveyed from our ſight to our Judgment without confuſion of the appearances; to cure that evil there needed no other medicine without doubt but our own view.</p>
                  <p>Conſider I pray you, my Child, in the perſon of a cholerick man, what Kind of monſter it is that toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes him within, whereof you only ſee the ſhadow and phantome in his countenance. Judg by the ſmoak, and ſoot which appear outwardly, what fire muſt be in his heart, and by the convulſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which his body endures, what kind of tyrant it is that hath ſeized his ſoul. They abuſe you who tell you that it is a ſhort rage; it's violence ſupplyes it's duration, it is of the nature of Giants, who (as the fable ſaith) being children at night become men by next morning.</p>
                  <p>Other vices inſinuate themſelves ſecretly by ſtealth, as if they were aſhamed to be ſeen, but this makes it's irruption into the heart like a tempeſt of fire, from which break forth many ſparks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome flie to the eyes, others to the cheeks, the tongue, lips, lung, joynts, leaving not one part of the body to the government of it's own ſpirits. Yea the mouth of him that ſuffers it, like that of a criminal, utters many words againſt his will being
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:29522:55"/>forced from him by the violence of the rack that he feels, and which are quite forgotten ſo ſoon as the ſtorm is over.</p>
                  <p>But if all theſe things be not ſufficient to give you inſtruction, learn at leaſt from the experience that I have had of it, that there is no vice in man ſo quick in it's conception, ſo ugly in it's action, ſo lyable to repentance, nor whoſe fruit is ſo bitter as of this. To conclude it is a kind of Epilepſie fouler than the falling ſickneſs, in that it is both active and paſſive. Hereby judge, my friends, of the beauty of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is it's contrary, and how pleaſing a thing it is to God, to men, and more ſtill to ones ſelf; to poſſeſs the body and ſoul in patience with all ſort of traquillity and eaſe.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVII. Of Revenge.</head>
                  <p>REvenge is the fruit that anger and hatred pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to themſelves, which God hath not reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to himſelf as the moſt dainty bit: but rather to pluck out of our hearts theſe two wild ſtocks, whoſe fruit is more dangerous ſtill than it's ſtem. Take but from anger and hatred the pleaſure of revenge, and you diſarm them both. Experience teaches us that wounds are cured by the powder of ſympathy; but Nature permits not that the ointment of antipathy ſhould produce the ſame effect. Experience like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhews us that our own blood which congeals in the mouth of a wound that we have received, is a more ſovereign balſam for the cure thereof, than the ſhedding of the blood of another.</p>
                  <p>This is properly the effect of Revenge, it ſcratches an ulcer that pains us, and that produceth a greater
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29522:56"/>inflammation; and at length a gangrene, a <hi>Piemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi> Captain who was under my guard almoſt ſix weeks in <hi>Savoy,</hi> confeſſed to me that he alone of threeſcore and three of his family remained alive and eſcaped being murthered, and that the family that was the enemy of his, which with women, children and ſervants conſiſted of fifty ſix ſouls, was totally extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>All things rightly conſidered, I know no remedy ſo treacherous to it's intention, as the remedy of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, whether we propoſe to our ſelves thereby to eaſe the hurt that we have received, or to puniſh the wicked doer; for we neither do the one nor other. I heal not my wound when I make a deeper in the body of mine enemy, and by revenging my ſelf on the wicked doer, I not only provoke him rather than correct him, but I become wicked my ſelf, by taking to me the power and authority which only belongs to the Law. I do worſe yet, for in doing of him injury by revenging my ſelf, I juſtifie what he hath done, and afford him new matter of a counter Revenge. An injury done violates only the Law, an injury returned does inſolently rob it of it's autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>When we revenge our ſelves by engaging with our enemy, we make him our equal; but by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of him, he loſeth that and becomes our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, a pardon carrying ſomewhat that is royal, and the character of Maſter? the wiſe man, when he tells us that it is honourable to forget paſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, teaches us our duty on this occaſion. The evil that is paſt is gone, let the troubleſome remembrance thereof ſink unto the ſame abyſs.</p>
                  <p>A wicked man in doing evil follows his trade; if you be a good man, it will be yours to do him good, there is not a more piercing thruſt than a good turn, it reacheth even to the heart, perhaps it may touch
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:29522:56"/>the heart of your enemy; at leaſt you will make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in doing him good, that he is ſo much the more wicked, that you are good; which is no ſlight Revenge. To tell you the truth, my children, the theory of theſe counſels is far more lovely than the practice of them eaſie: God preſerve us all from an injury that deſerves a juſt reſentment, for fear leſt ſo ſlippery a ſtep may not diſcover the weakneſs of our ſtrength, on that occaſion.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVIII. Of Fear.</head>
                  <p>REvenge never gives us but in the blade the fruit which it propoſes for our ſatisfaction. Fear does yet worſe, it gives us ſuch a ſhake by ſeizing on us that it makes the leaf, flower, and fruit, that it promiſes, fall. It ſeems that it only looks to our ſecurity, and nevertheleſs from the very minute that it is formed in our mind, trouble ariſeth with it: we may with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon call it the uſurer of our misfortunes; for in ſtead of ſome one or other which only threatens us, it calls together all thoſe that apprehenſion can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; and is ſo forward in it's diligence, that it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten turns an imaginary evil into a real torment. If even the beſt fruits gathered before their maturity be ſowre, what can be the foretaſt of an evil which is not as yet come to it's ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Fear is an art of prolonging miſery, which joyns the paſt with the preſent; (witneſs the ſurpriſe of one of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Lieutenants at the ſole ſight of his ſtatue) and with greater pomp the future with the preſent, in ſo much that preſent evils come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us but one and one, and that the future preſent themſelves always to our imagination in groſs. In
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:29522:57"/>this rencounter let us not ſuffer fortune who will ſave us from ſome of them, and perhaps from all, to be kinder to us, than we are to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>As that apprehenſion of the future, which does not as yet exiſt, is but a baſtard ſprout of humane prudence, ſo the impreſſion that it makes on us is not ſo ſudden, nor ſo unconſiderate, as that of a preſent fear. This laſt takes no counſel, it ſo binds up in us all the functions of body and ſoul, that we remain without action, or if we retain any, it is only to throw us into a greater precipice than that which we would avoid; this is directly oppoſed to fortitude, and ſo much the more ſhameful in a Gentleman, that valour ought to be his moſt eſſential quality.</p>
                  <p>Child, Fright at a preſent danger, is diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and the fear of a future will diſturb you: take heart, I pray you, againſt both, if it be prudence to diſcover a future evil, it is none to foreſtal it: let not the dint of fortune which threatens you, ſtrike at a diſtance, leſt you be ſo much the more weakned, when you come to grapple with it. The fear, which is not only allowed, but abſolutely commanded, is the fear of God, which is the beginning of wiſdom; And I pray the Lord to beſtow it on you.</p>

                  <p>ENvy is yet a more troubleſome Gueſt to the ſoul, which I adviſe you never to harbour in your heart. Hatred upon a juſt reſenting of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived injury, may enter it by force; Envy can never be admitted, unleſs invited: but when it is once entertained, it is the only vice which dallies not, and is never reconciled to virtue, till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:29522:57"/>death. Grant not to that lean and meagre Gueſt, which feeds only on Vipers, the ſame lodging which God has reſerved in you for himſelf. Detracting from the honour of another is a ſhameful fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a mind affected with that diſtemper. If by diminiſhing of it you could piece up your own, there might be ſomething to be ſaid, but on the contrary you thereby loſe what little you may have.</p>
                  <p>An evil eye begets not only the hatred and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of him that it beholds, but likewiſe of all thoſe that ſee the malignity of it's aſpect. Envy is rather an homage payed to the virtue of another, than a pique; and ſee the effect of it. Of two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors, the enviours voluntarily yields the place, though fortune did grant it him: and it very often comes to paſs, that by rubbing on other mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we make them bright, and thereby more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious.</p>
                  <p>This vice without any plauſible pretext or excuſe, as others have, is alike common to the great, as to the mean, becauſe the mean cannot with patience abide that the virtue of thoſe of their condition ſhould place them at a diſtance from them; nor the great that their inferiours ſhould come near them: inſtead of this mutual envy, the mean would do better to tread the ſteps of thoſe that go before them, and the great to keep their advantage.</p>
                  <p>There are few noble Families that have not had ſome predeceſſour raiſed by his fortune, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs could not be made without changing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval that was betwixt him, and the men of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his time, his poſterity may do the ſame: and therefore, my children, I intreat you; to have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem for thoſe that raiſe themſelves by their vertue, one day they may lend you a hand, and they that follow after by your example, will puſh you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XX. Of Grief and Sadneſs.</head>
                  <p>There are not many paſſions which are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in us with violence, but Sadneſs is of the number of thoſe, that breed in the ſoul by a free acquieſcency of the will: we have ſo great a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to it, that beſide that all vices are in the end dog'd with an inward ſorrow which attends them, the leaſt croſs accident brings it upon us without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſiſtance. Let it be the puniſhment of our vices, for we deſerve it: it is juſt that evil ſhould beget e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but that the accidents of life to which humane nature is ſubject, and which come on us from the hand of God, ſhould afflict and make us ſad, is a thing that we ſhould not permit.</p>
                  <p>Sadneſs is ſo eſſential a mark of a ſinner, that by that alone the Scripture diſcovers to us the heart of an hypocrite, God in his juſt Judgment being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that his concealed enemy, though he may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe himſelf in appearances, being gnawed by the internal worm of his conſcience, ſhould carry always on his forehead the ſtamp of puniſhment which his diſloyalty deſerves, and that is ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>This paſſion is in ſome ſort the viſible image of hell, inaſmuch as by the loſs of the good which we lament, it robs us of the uſe and reliſh of thoſe we poſſeſs, and that it ſo much infects with it's bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all the functions of our ſoul, that it kills in it the love of our ſelves, and our gratitude toward God.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, my child, how far the induſtry of a man that afflicts himſelf advances; who by making a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of all poſſible felicities, of Riches, Pleaſures,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:29522:58"/>and Honours, compoſes of all theſe bleſſings which are wanting to him, the venom that empoyſons him. Make better uſe, I pray you, of ſickneſs, croſſes of fortune, and an infinite number of other evils which you ſuffer not, which are many more in number than thoſe that lie upon you; make of them rather a preſervative and antidote againſt this deadly poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>If there be any ſorrow excuſable, it ſhould be for the loſs of a Father, a kind Brother, a wiſe Son, a truſty Friend, a good Maſter, or for the death of a faithful Wife, which is rather a diſmembring of our ſelves than a ſeparation. It is not in our power to forget the memory of them: and though it were, that forgetfulneſs being a kind of annihilation of the thing loved, I ſhould never adviſe you ſo barbarous a remedy; for it is true that on ſuch hard occaſions, which have their root in the midſt of our bowels, it would be inhumane to be inſenſible.</p>
                  <p>What muſt we then do for our comfort? Weep o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the dead as our Saviour did, raiſe him again by a ſweet reviving of his memory; and leave our grief buried with him in the ſame grave, ſince we cannot retrive him from thence. The fable by turning into ſtone the infortunate Mother after the death of all her children, inſtructs us that we are of too ſoft a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſuffer in fleſh and bone an evil of that nature: Inſomuch notwithſtanding that an extream ſorrow ſeems to be a ſecret repining againſt providence, let us humble our ſelves before it, and acknowledg that there is no internal grief whoſe continuance is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely lawful, but what afflicts us for the evil which we do. That ſorrow alone kills ſin, raiſes the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and reſtores to him joy and gladneſs.</p>

                  <p>AS there is nothing that marks ſo much ſin to us, as Sadneſs, ſo likewiſe there is no ſolid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment but what ſprings from virtue.

If fortune be the cauſe of it, ſhe is always treacherous, what ever ſhe do.

                  <p>Joy, which proceeds not from vertue, fails often in it's bulk: if it be little, it is imperceptible: if exceſſive, there is danger that the heart of man prove not too weak and ſmall a veſſel to contain it's overflowing without being ſplit and broken.</p>

As to the pleaſure that ſpring from the two great abundance of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, it is ſo ſudden in it's act; that it is as ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct as kindled: if it be urged too much, it is put out of breath; and by continuance, degenerates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to feebleneſs.</p>
                  <p>The ſmelling is for the bad as well as good ſmells: the latter if they be a little ſtrong, make the head ake as well as the former, inſtead of comforting the brain. As concerning the hearing, if jarring diſcord trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſoul, harmony diſſolves and ſoftens it, and diſplaces it from it's ſeat. Seeing, which is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of all our ſenſes wearies at length of the beauty of it's object, what it admired at firſt glance, only pleaſes it at the ſecond look; at the third it does not as yet offend it, but in proceſs of time it is cloyed by the frequent cuſtom of eying it. In a word, my children, the pleaſure of our ſenſes, though they were even always ſatisfied, is but ſuperficial; it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects only the extremities of the organs that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined for their functions; if it come nearer and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate with them, from that inſtant it ceaſes to be ſenſible.</p>
                  <p>As to what concerns the contentment which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Glory, Dignities, Nobility, Authority, and Riches afford; the opinion of thoſe who conſider theſe things but as imaginary goods, or inſtruments of our vanity, is, in my judgement, a little too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere. Though vertue may find in it ſelf content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet humane policy, to provoke men to emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in well doing, hath moſt wiſely appointed Honour, Glory, Dignities, and Nobility, to be a viſible homage which ſhould be rendered to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and that Authority and Riches ſhould be the means to give greater extent to it's operations.</p>
                  <p>All theſe goods, notwithſtanding, ought to make
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:29522:60"/>no other impreſſion on us, but as goods of retinue and attendance, which are but the baggage of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; for in effect Honour and Eſteem is but a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vapour, which is derived to us onely from the fancy of another; Nobility but a politick acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of ſervice performed, and Authority but a power to maintain with Dignity the Laws, which the ſame Laws confer upon us; all theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but forein conceſſions, can eſtabliſh in us no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid contentment: nothing but vertue alone whoſe acts are all our own, can beſtow it.</p>
                  <p>As it is impoſſible but that a body of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, lovely, healthful and vigorous, muſt be ſenſible of the pleaſure that there is in the enjoyment of all theſe bleſſings; ſo by the ſame reaſon, when the ſoul is purged from all it's perturbations, which are it's maladies, when it wills nothing but what is honeſt, and juſt, wherein conſiſts it's true beauty, and that it is always in readineſs to do good, it cannot be in that condition, and not feels already ſome foretaſt of the joys of heaven.</p>
                  <p>Would to God, my friends, that ye were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to know the happineſs of thoſe who have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that perfection, and that ye could ſee preſented to the eye in ſome worthy ſubject a living ſcheme of the excellence of vertue, to the end that the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble object of it's beauty might attract you with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter violence to the Love of it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXII. That we must chooſe a profeſſion. Of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Arms, and what ought to be the firſt inſtitution thereof.</head>
                  <p>HAving diſcourſed to you, my child, concerning your manners, and the vices that may corrupt them, I come now to ſpeak of the profeſſion that you are obliged to follow; for though we have all one and the ſame original, yet the wiſdom of him who is the author of it, hath been pleaſed that there ſhould be amongſt us many different conditions and trades, all which ſhould ſtand in need of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the end that the mutual ſervice which is performed in that diverſity, might be to us all a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bond of love: wherefore, my friends, that we may not be uſeleſs members of this community, every one of us ought to propoſe to our ſelves, a courſe of life which may according to nature and Law ſatisfie this publick duty.</p>
                  <p>Upon the account of that common obligation, it is my intention that two of my three Sons ſerve the King in his Armies, and that the third be a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, provided he be endued with the good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that ſo holy a Calling requires; if not, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign him likewiſe for a Souldier, though I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready loſt three elder Brothers Children, one before <hi>Corbie,</hi> another before <hi>Perpignan,</hi> and the third in the return from the Siege of <hi>Thionvile:</hi> and likewiſe three Siſters Children, whereof the one died in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, the other killed before <hi>St. Antonin,</hi> and the third at the Battel of <hi>Nordlinguen,</hi> yet we muſt not forſake the Trade.</p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:29522:61"/>
                  <p>I am not ignorant that a Souldier is only a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice devoted for the ſervice of his King and Country; that he is their Martyr, and that our Kings have more reaſon to call the Gentlemen the Limits of their Dominions, conſidering the Progreſs of our Wars, than that Ancient, who ſhewing his fellow Citizens, ſaid that they were the Walls of the Town.</p>
                  <p>Since it is ſo, I think there ſhould be a little more care taken of their primary inſtitution for the wars, and that it were to be wiſhed that there were ſome place in the Kingdom that might ſerve for nurſeries, where the Gentry, when they leave the Colledge and the Livery, might be trained in the exerciſe of Arms, and that in ſuch places there were Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies for riding the great Horſe, for Vaulting, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, Fencing; for Arithmetick, Coſmography, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, and the Languages, whereof the Maſters were entertained at the publick charge, for the uſe and benefit of the Children of poor Gentlemen who may have died or grown aged in the ſervice. The matter is not without example, two perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity have done heretofore at their own coſt, to wit Monſieur <hi>de St. Luke</hi> in <hi>Brouage,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Vic</hi> at <hi>Calais,</hi> with ſo much honour and reputation, that there was never a younger Brother that came out of their Garriſons, who did not reſpect them as long as they lived as much as the King, and honour them more than their Parents.</p>
                  <p>That little expence is very inconſiderable in ſo great a Kingdom as this, in reſpect of the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that may redound from it. In the firſt place, what bad habit a Page may have learned in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Lackeys where he hath been bread, and from whom he only differs by the faſhion of his breech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, will turn to diſcretion when he comes to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by his Officers, his Maſters and the reſt of the Gentlemen that run the ſame career with him.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:29522:61"/>The Scholar that leaves the Colledg, ill-bred, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and wild, will learn grace and aſſurance, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in a company more reſolute and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed than that from which he parted: whereas if a Page after his commerce with Lackeys turn himſelf ſtreight over into the Guards, the contagion of the Pickpocket or Highway-man may in a great City prove dangerous: and it is likewiſe to be feared, leſt a young Scholar, being but a freſh-water Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, may not for want of a good Tutor forſake the ſervice, when he finds that in his noviciat he is the ſport of his Comrades in that place, where there is more licence given than in a well ordered Garriſon.</p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe very conſiderable that young men leave the Colledge and the Livery of the Page, in the flower of their age, and that this flower is blaſted without bearing any fruit, or if it bear any, it is bad, if it be but in the leaſt neglected. In this fair ſeaſon the blood and ſpirits, which are in their prime, are very dangerous Counſellors, if the motion of their impulſe have it's free courſe. So that it is a matter of pity and commiſeration to ſee young men, who leave the Family of a perſon of quality, to whom perhaps by reaſon of his negligence, they have only been known by his Liveries; or come out of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge where they have learned nothing but what muſt be forgotten, for want of skill in Tutors for the education of youth, left to their own conduct.</p>
                  <p>After ſuch ſhipwrack of their firſt years, it is to heap evil upon evil to ſend them into a Garriſon, where all that they have to do, is once in three days to mount the Guard. By the ſloth of the other two the mind is in danger of becoming more lazy than the body. Againſt this inconvenience I ſee no other remedy, but the different exerciſes which I have propoſed, which by their variety might always keep in breath the bodies and minds of youth, and by a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:29522:62"/>laudable emulation of ſtriving to excel, break the bonds of evil habits before contracted, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce better in their place.</p>
                  <p>It would now be very ſuperfluous to ſend our Youth into <hi>Holland;</hi> the ſucceſs of our Arms, and the diligence of our Sieges, make appear that of Scholars we are become Maſters in that Trade; and beſides I have found by experience in two journies that I made there as a Volunteer, the one at the Rupture of the Truce, and the other during the Siege of <hi>Breda,</hi> a younger Brother, though of thirty ſix years of age at the firſt, and of forty at the ſecond, that Brandy and Tobacco made in that place the greater ſhare of the Exerciſes of our cadets.</p>
                  <p>I am much of opinion that what I propoſe, is but a wiſh in the blade, whereof I neither expect flower nor fruit. So that knowing no Garriſon in the Kingdom where there is any care taken of the Youth, I would adviſe you, my Children, before ye go to the Army, to ſerve the King a year in his Guards: ye owe him the firſt fruits of your ſervices; there the Grandees of the Nation are to be ſeen in groſs, elſewhere they appear but in retail: whilſt in that place you learn the duty of a Souldier, you will neither want Maſters nor time for your other exerciſes, provided you have diſcretion to manage it aright in the ſame place. The commerce of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, the Officer, the Citizen, Tradeſman, Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocket, Religious, and the Preſence of the Court, may offer you at one glance a general view of the order and diſorder of the world, the conſideration of which will not be altogether uſeleſs to you for your conduct: ſo after that your years of noviciat in the Guards is expired, you may go and make your profeſſion in the Army.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXIII. Seven Counſels for a Souldier.</head>
                  <p>HItherto, my Children, I have treated you as a good Father, who teaches his Children their firſt ſteps, and holds them up by the ſtrings; but when I now conſider you as entred into the Trade, beſide the quality of Father, which I had before, I acquire likewiſe over you the quality of an ancient Officer, and on this double reſpect ye own more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and regard to my Counſels concerning the profeſſion to which ye are called.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="counsel">

                     </head>
                     <p>The firſt counſel that I give you, my Son, is, that if you perceive that your heart is not good for the wars, and that you are not fully reſolved faithfully to ſerve the King, you meddle not that way: though your quality oblige you to it, yet no body will force you: the Arrear-ban is now no more in uſe, and though it were, the prudence of our Laws allows you to ſupply your place in the ſervice by another, who may be of more worth than your ſelf. Add not to the Cowardiſe of your heart, Sacriledge, in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating by baſeneſs, or infidelity, the Oath which you make, of true and faithful ſerving the King. The promiſe which you give at the head of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment with hand lifted up to Heaven, is a ſolemn Vow in the preſence of God and men, which is no leſs obligatory than others. Theſe are but made once in ones life, yours is renewed at every Muſter. Their pay is only in credit and hope, yours is in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:29522:63"/>preſent money; yea, we may ſay that by deſerting they commit but a private treſpaſs, and you a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick crime.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, my Child, die rather than do the leaſt thing in the Army which may diſhonour you, for you will have there too many witneſſes of your ſhame. The antient Diſcipline that puniſhed the Coward with death, was not ſo ſevere as ours, which prolongs the ſenſe of his diſgrace, by letting him outlive his honour.</p>

                     <p>My ſecond advice is, that you be not obſtinate in the fight longer than the enemy makes head againſt you: when they are once broken, and that there is no more hopes of rallying, deſiſt, and let thoſe who have need to be fleſhed with booty compleat the overthrow. Defile not your ſelf with the blood of him that flies, and far leſs of him that renders him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Wounds given on the back are more diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than wounds there received. You are in fear of him whom you ſtrike in that condition, and by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him alone, you ſlight him. There are three ſorts of courage in an Army, the firſt begins the victory, the ſecond purſues it, and the laſt makes the Maſſacre: ſtrive you to be of the firſt.</p>

                     <p>If any one render himſelf priſoner to you, being of that quality that you may diſpoſe of him at your pleaſure, let him appoint his own ranſom: if he will not promiſe you any thing, do a deed of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without opening your purſe, and ſend him go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: if he promiſe you any thing, ſet him at liberty upon his parole; if he fail in performance, believe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:29522:63"/>that it hath been his inability to make ſatisfaction, and that in vain you ſhould have aſſured him of his life, if you had deprived him of what was needful to maintain it: to ſay the truth, ſuch a traffick is but a ſign of low ambition.</p>

A great Train, rich Furniture, and a ſumptuous Table, are but the falſe appearances of it; affect them not, if you want eſtate enough to ſupport the expences: All theſe things which ſerve only for oſtentation, will be ſo many enemies to your duty which you have lodged in your breaſt.</p>

                     <p>NOw as to the ways which you muſt take in ſeeking that which they call your Fortune, I have no other counſel to give you, but that you preſent your ſelf always to her in the places where ſhe may ſee you, that is at Court or in the Army, and that when you are there you let her diſpoſe of you according to her good pleaſure. Let it be your care patiently to expect what ſhe ſhall beſtow on your endeavours, otherwiſe you will meet with croſs hits. Experience hath taught me that ſhe is a Miſtreſs that only deſires the aſſiduity of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and will not be forced to any thing but what ſhe pleaſes; and that they themſelves, whoſe hand make the diſtribution of her favours, expect, as ſhe doth, the ſame ſubmiſſion. I have found that it was in vain that I propoſed to my ſelf to die, or to ſqueez from her ſome better luck than I have had, my life having been preſerved almoſt in deſpight of me, without having received but a very ſmall ſhare of her favours.</p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:29522:65"/>
                     <p>It is true ſhe offered me once the Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels place of the Regiment of Sieur <hi>Luc,</hi> at preſent <hi>Perſan,</hi> which I ſhould have accepted, if at that time I had not been threatned with a Conſumption: And four years ago the late Mareſchal of <hi>Vitry</hi> ſent to my houſe to offer me the ſame place in the Queens Regiment: but my inability to bear the expences of it, obliged me to make within my ſelf this wiſe reflexion, that in the age that I was in, my Family had more need of my preſence, than the King of my ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding whatever my little fortune hath been, I have all reaſon to thank God that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me the grace honeſtly to ſubſiſt by the Revenue of the Altar in the ſervice of the Altar; and to have continued in it a conſiderable enough time without any ſhame or diſgrace that I know of, to have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made up as much as hath reimburſed what I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced of my eſtate in the firſt years of my ſervices, and that his providence hath permitted for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that I was diſcharged of a place where my conſtant attendance would have hindred me from meeting with your Mother, as now I have, from whence I have the bleſſing of your birth, my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and another ſupply which I muſt not publiſh, by means whereof I receive yearly the ſame Rents which I had of the King, when I was one of his Officers.

                     <p>I have yet another very conſiderable advice to give you, my Children, concerning the Progreſs of the courſe of your fortune; and that is, that you liſten
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:29522:65"/>to the counſel of your friends: but if it be quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your own, and you in age to make the choice of the ways that you ſhould take, follow the inclination of your genius, if you find that it preſſes you with violence. Our deſigns being meaſured according to the extent of our ſouls, whether great or ſmall, you can hardly meet with one of your own gage which fits you ſo exactly, that in the execution thereof another mans meaſure may not be either longer or ſhorter than your own. And that is the reaſon why every one of us is wiſe enough in his own affairs, provided he apply himſelf thereto, becauſe he conducts them according to his own meaſures. The diverſity of age, conſtitution, quality, and intereſt, are ſo many different ſhadowings in the aſpect of the exiſtence of things, whoſe variety hinders the counſels of others from agreeing well with ours about the means which are altogether proportionate to us.</p>
                     <p>Great actions which we ſee ſucceed, although that before their execution they appeared to us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, can only proceed from an inward impulſe of ſome particular ſpirit of conduct, that compels him that does them, to undertake them in ſpight of his reaſon, otherways they would never come to paſs.</p>
                     <p>This is the ſole reaſon, why Common-wealths are not wont to make ſo great progreſſes as Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, in reſpect that all great deſigns have in them always ſomewhat of danger; and that in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities the deſire of preſervation is popular and more univerſal than that of enlarging themſelves: add, that it is altogether impoſſible that ſo many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſpirits which have their vote in Council can make a common and uniform prognoſtick of the ſucceſs of the matter in deliberation, whether it ſhall proſper, or not; whereas when all things are
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:29522:66"/>ruled by the will of a ſingle perſon, we ſee great deſigns ſucceed, whether it be that his foreſight brings near to him, as with Teleſcopes, the ſucceſs of the future, which is imperceptible to many eyes that look differently on things, or that without any more conſultation he yields a blind obedience to the impulſe of his genius, which aſſures him of the event. Hence proceed the incredible actions which are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved in Monarchies under the Government of an excellent Prince, or the direction of ſome wiſe and diſcreet Miniſter of State during his minority; witneſs the example of the preſent reign: or under a Prince, who in his majority hath had the prudence to aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate to himſelf in affairs ſome wiſe confident of State; witneſs the example of the preceding reign, which probably might have produced ſomewhat yet greater, if the regular motion of the direction had not been often retarded by that of the principal wheel, which was not always concentrick with it.</p>
                     <p>In verity when I call to mind that I have ſeen a Gentleman of <hi>Poitou,</hi> a younger Brother of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, (which was indeed good, but entangled with affairs) propoſe to himſelf before that he was as yet called to publick Miniſtry, to reſtore to the King the places which the Proteſtants held in the Kingdom; and to change the great deſigns of the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> into a neceſſity of keeping what they had, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of getting more; I find my ſelf wholly convinced (conſidering the difficulty of the project) to believe that if he had not had a particular ſpirit of wiſdom that ſhewed him to the eye the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of all theſe things, he had never enterpriſed them.</p>
                     <p>The regaining of <hi>Rhé,</hi> the taking of <hi>Nancy,</hi> the laſt relief of <hi>Caſal,</hi> of <hi>Leucate,</hi> and of the City of <hi>Turin,</hi> are actions too bold, (if it may be ſaid) to have been undertaken according to the meaſures of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:29522:66"/>an ordinary conduct, by thoſe that did them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome internal foreknowledge of their ſucceſs. And though the Battel of <hi>Rocroy,</hi> which was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that of <hi>Fribourg,</hi> and it, with the Battel of <hi>Nordlinguen,</hi> be the certain effects of a prudence that acts always with the ſame vigour: Nevertheleſs theſe actions are of ſuch a pitch, conſidering the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time, place, and of the age of him that contrived, and executed them all with his own hand, that they appear to all thoſe that look upon them at diſtance, to be the expeditions of a divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſpired oldneſs. His Highneſs will pardon me, I hope, theſe extraordinary impulſes have ſometime ſo ſudden and unforeſeen a motion, that they break out like thoſe ſweet chaces of Muſick, whereof the art is concealed, and which tranſport him that ſings out of himſelf; and raviſhes him after they are performed, with the ſame admiration as thoſe that hear him.</p>
                     <p>Children, we cannot acknowledge providence in great things, unleſs we own it likewiſe in ſmall, all things here below being equally ſmall in reſpect of God. From the pattern of theſe great Souls, of whom I have been ſpeaking, we have ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the leſſer, ſuch as ours, have their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mover for their direction, as well as thoſe that appear great in regard of us.</p>

                     <p>It is above all moſt important that the deſigns of great men which are attended with a great Train of conſequences, ſhould always have an aim to ſome honeſt end: if it be otherways, and that there is a breach of publick peace made within or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſtate, the calamities that depend thereon, make men eye the life of thoſe that cauſe the: if it be ſhort, it appears like a Whirlwind and Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane that overthrows every thing that comes in its way, and which is at length ſpent by its own violence. But if it be of long duration, it is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as thoſe great inundations which drown a whole Countrey, the remains of which, if any there be, appear only like Towers and Tops of Steeples half drowned, which ſubſiſt in the midſt of their ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack for no other end but to point out better the horror of the Deluge.</p>

There is no fame good or bad, but for great men, the reputation of the meaner is loſt in the multitude, and therefore their inclination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a good end ſhould be more violent than ours; they ſee that thereby alone their name is continued, that many ages after their death they have ſtill an union with the living by the veneration that men have for them, and that their memory growing old yields a ſweeter ſmell, as that of the wicked a more ſtinking ſcent, by reaſon of the bad end which they

                  <head>CHAP. XXV. Five Counſels concerning the conduct of ones Family.</head>
                  <p>HAving diſcourſed to you, my Children, of the honeſt end, which all your actions ought to have, I come now to the conduct of your Houſe, which is a matter of no ſmall importance. If like Knights Errant we found always our Equipage rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and a covered Table, I ſhould adviſe you to follow, as they do, the courſe of your adventures, without troubling your ſelves farther: but ſeeing you have need of the ſmall portion that I leave you, to ſerve you for ammunition bread, until the King give you other, it is convenient that you know how it is to be managed. The Laws allow us not the diſpoſal of our Eſtates before we be five and twenty years of age, whether it has been their ſcope not to abandon to young age, which is expenſive and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate, a Viatick whereof old age ſtands more in need, or that they have had ſome other regard, they ſeem to me very prudent in having ſuſpended our power of acting in buſineſs until that age; in reſpect that the conduct of a Family which is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, would have made too great a diverſion of our firſt years, which are more profitably imployed in the ſtudy of the Profeſſion that we intend to follow, than in any other buſineſs whatſoever. For that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:29522:68"/>effect our Statutes have ordained that the character of Prieſt or Judge ſhould not be conferred on any before the five and twentieth year of age, to give more time for one to render himſelf capable of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that alſo becauſe it would not be at all reaſonable that one ſhould be the Judge of another man's conſcience, before he knew how to govern his own; nor that we ſhould have Juriſdiction upon the goods that are not ours, and not upon our own. You ſee, my Son, that in theſe two Offices one muſt have attained to a certain age before he can make profeſſion of them; in this your employment has the advantage of them, wherein to obtain command; the time, nor the years of ſervice are not reckoned, only the merit and price of him that is engaged in it, is taken notice of. There has been one known to have had the diſpoſal of all the Commands of an Army by Law, who by the ſame Law being as yet under age had not the power of his Eſtate. The paſt and preſent ages furniſh us with rich examples of this, which I wave, that I may return to the meaſures that I would have you follow in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of your Family.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. In the firſt place, my Children, after that you have rendered your firſt ſervices to the Publick, the intereſt of which goes before your own, I would have you at the age of five and twenty take the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of your Eſtate, ſeeing that the Laws, who are our wiſe Counſellors, give you the poſſeſſion of it at that age.</p>
                  <p>I leave you no Law-ſuit, have not any amongſt your ſelves, I charge you, nor with your Neighbours either, if you can avoid it. It is my wiſh that there ſhould be no need of any other law betwixt you and them, but of the Law of your own conſcience. If there be any commenced againſt you, ſtrive to take it up amicably, and rather yield a little of your
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:29522:68"/>right, than bring it to a tryal. One arreſt begets another, and that a third: nevertheleſs if you muſt come to a tryal, expect from your Judges what God ſhall be pleaſed to inſpire into them for your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. When you ſolicit them, beg of them only attention to your cauſe: any other deſire beſide that of attention, ſolicits them to their diſhonour. Tell them the naked truth concerning your Buſineſs, though it may do you hurt, they ill thereupon prove more indulgent to you. What ever ſentence be pronounced, render the ſame reſpect to your Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as if God himſelf had given it. They that ſit on his tribunal, what ever they do, are ſtill the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of his will.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is my opinion alſo that you endeavour to get ſome general Notions of your right and family cuſtomes, to the end that you may not ſo blindly give your ſelf over to the direction of thoſe to whom you commit the care of your affairs, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be able to know if they faithfully acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their charge or not: eye them attentively, the Maſters eye that makes a fat Horſe, ſhould have a care that his Servant devour not too much, or that he be not ill ſerved by him. When a ſervant thinks himſelf ſecure under the blind confidence of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, from being faithful he turns perfidious; and from being careful, lazie. In fine it comes often to paſs that by this negligence a Maſter finds himſelf more under the government of his ſervant, than the affairs are, which are committed to his care.</p>
                  <p>I give you this counſel, my Children, without believing that it can be applyed to your fortune, for it is ſo ſmall that it requires no other ſteward but your ſelf. But having had the deſign under the name of you, to call to a ſhare of this Legacy all the youth of what condition and quality ſoever, I find my ſelf engaged to inſert in it a great many things, which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:29522:69"/>are rather of publick uſe than your private concern.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. In ſpeaking to you, I give advice to all who may have need of aſſiſtance in the ordering of their affairs, never to make uſe of a ſordid or mechanick perſon. A baſe fellow, by his ſneaking husbanding of a trifle communicates the contagion of his Soul to the thing that he manages: he pollutes like the Harpyes whatever he touches, and beſmears them with I know not what filth, that may reflect on him that employs him. We may ſay of ſordid and ſneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaving, that for every ounce it ſpares it ſpends a hundred weight of reputation, it is only profitable to him that uſes it, inſomuch that it ſerves as a lure for a greater confidence and truſt. Every ſordid wretch is greedy, and none that are greedy can be faithful. He looks upon the goods that you put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands as his prey, and manages them as ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly as if they were already his own. If he ſeem faithful in the conduct of the ſmall ſtreams which ſhould fill the Ciſtern, it is only that he may draw more largely and ſecurely out of it's depth, obſerve him narrowly in matters which he thinks you do not mind, and you will quickly diſcover that he is a good husband only for himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Make no uſe either of a jangling Pettifog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he is a kind of <hi>Croat</hi> that skirmiſhes and flies and whoſe ſeol ſtrength conſiſts in tricks, who for want of knowledg to cut a Law-ſuit by the root, contents himſelf to ſplit and ſlice it, from whence ſpring an infinite number of new ſprouts; when on the other hand a knowing man in one breath drives a matter to the end, and brings the remedy to the ſource of the evil. In fine the ſnare that a pettifogger lays, is either ſo coarſe that it is diſcovered, or ſo fine that it is broken. So that it is only pitched for his own Maſter, who is perhaps alſo the only prey that he hunts for.</p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:29522:69"/>
                  <p n="5">V. Wherefore it is very neceſſary that you make frequent reviews of the affairs of your houſe, to the end you may ſee how your Servants carry themſelves. Buſineſs hath indeed at firſt ſomething harſh and rude in that it abſtracts us from our ſelves to it. Let us do better, let us attract it to us, and it will become more familiar. The firſt temporal petition that we make to God, if for our daily bread, if he beſtow it on us, let us quicken our natural light for the managing of it, rather than extinguiſh it by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning of it blindly to the conduct of another. Inſtruction in our private affairs, will make us know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the publick; Becauſe that the common Law of the ſtate binding us all in ſubjection to one and the ſame Duty, I cannot know in what manner I ſhould honeſtly and lawfully diſpoſe of what is mine own, but that I muſt have at the ſame time a notion of what ought to be done in the Family of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="26" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. XXVI. That one ought to have ſome general notions of publick affairs. That they can only be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Court: and wherefore one ſhould ſpend ſome part of his Life there.</head>
                  <p>It is likewiſe my Judgment , ſeeing that every one of us makes but a part of a greater whole, that you ſhould acquire ſome general notions, of the manner how this great body whereof you are a part, is governed, and of what parts it is compoſed. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souls aſſembled together, make a Family, many Families a Town and City, many Towns a Province, and many Provinces a State, which is governed by the power and authority of a ſingle Perſon, from
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:29522:70"/>which is derived a common Law, that makes the union of all theſe parts together, from whence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts a mutual correſpondence between the head and the members, and the members and the head, for the common preſervation of the whole. This total is compoſed of four different conditions of men; of the Nobility and Gentry, the Clergy, the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and the common People. From the concourſe of the Services of each of theſe conditions, and their juſt harmony among themſelves, peace and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the publick depend.</p>
                  <p>The Clergy entertain the union betwixt God and the State: the Nobility and Gentry ſecure it at home and abroad by their arms: the Judges keep it in concord under the authority of the Law, and the common People contribute to it by their ſubſtance. So great is the good underſtanding of the Prince with theſe different degrees of his ſubjects, that our Kings have almoſt as often ſaid, that they were the firſt Burgeſſe of their chief City, as they have called themſelves the firſt Gentlemen of their Kingdom. their ſeat of Juſtice and Unction at their Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, teſtifie alſo that they are the chief Juſtices, and firſt Prelates. So that he being head over all, there ought to be a mutual reſpect from one condition to another, of which in every ſeveral ſtate the King is pleaſed to be the firſt head.</p>
                  <p>My child, you have a place in this great body: if you can underſtand how it is governed, you will fill your place better and more to your own ſatisfaction. though your quality call you to a profeſſion for the which ſome barbarous ages have believed ignorance to be the greateſt and moſt ſucceſsful qualification, yet there are others more diſcreet, who are of an other opinion. Amongſt the moſt warlike People that ever have been, the Generals of the Army com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down from their triumphant Chairs have been
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:29522:70"/>ever now and then ſeen, aſſiſting in the Council of ſtate, giving counſel to Clients, diſcharging the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Judge, great Surveyer, and Treaſurer of the Exchecquer, and from thence to return again to the command of Armies, which is an evidence that theſe functions were not inconſiſtent together. We need not ſearch for diſtant examples of this, our progreſſes in <hi>Flanders</hi> proceed only from this, that our firſt Princes of the blood, do as worthily fill the firſt places in Council as in the command of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and that to be a good head in counſel, and a good head in War, is equally the effect of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                  <p>Were there no other profit to be reaped from that ſtudy, but the ſatisfaction to ſee by how many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent pipes the ſtream of the chief command is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived even to the loweſt parts of the State, and how the return of obedience remounts to the fountain head of Authority, yet that alone is a pleaſant thing to be conſidered. That knowledg is more eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired than men imagine to themſelves: the reading of the Statutes and Acts of Parliament, aſſiſted with ſome conference with thoſe of the profeſſion, of whom you may find all ſorts at Court, will in ſhort time furniſh you with that knowledg, which as a lovely Anatomy of ſtate will repreſent to you in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at one view all the different parts whereof ours is compoſed. It is no ſmall ſatisfaction to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſymmetry of a body whereof we make a part, though that knowledg ſhould ever remain idle in us, without making any Application of it.</p>
                  <p>That ſtudy, my Son, cannot be followed but at Court, in reſpect that the Court contains all the noble parts of this great body, one muſt ſpend a part of his Life there, and endeavour being already the Kings ſubject, to obtain ſome place or penſion in his Family. Employ the beſt of your Services
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:29522:71"/>and years in that deſign. But if fortune croſs you in this as ſhe hath me, when you begin to grow old think of your retreat; for that age is a dull and dead ſeaſon, which produceth no fruit.</p>
                  <p>An old Courtier that is ſtill in purſuit of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, deſerves as much deriſion as an old Lover: the miſtriſſes whom at that time either ſerve, can do them no greater favour, than to deny them what they beg, whereof perhaps the functions would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their ſtrength. If any thing be allowed to their importunity, if ſhould be reckoned a gracious gift, which obligeth but to very little or no ſervice at all.</p>
                  <p>Although that the diſtribution of earthly goods ſeem when we come into the World, already made, nevertheleſs our portions are not ſo fixed and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that they can neither increaſe nor diminiſh, God being willing for the preſerving of ſome equality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, that the ebbing and flowing of fortune ſhould now and then make a new diviſion of them. The Court is the moſt conſiderable ſtage of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitude, there great men riſe, and fall to give place to their riſing inferiours, who likewiſe ruine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſame place to make way again for others. It is here that the ſwifteſt motion of this revolution appears: in the Country it is like the motion about the axletree, which is ſo ſlow that it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible. We ſhould do wrong to complain of this viciſſitude; ſeeing it is an effect of providence, which makes appear to men what it calls every one of them by turn to the enjoyment of goods and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: and becauſe the order that it obſerves, is to us unknown, we inconſiderately call the action of God by the name of Fortune.</p>
                  <p>The Court, as I have ſaid, is the chief theatre of this change, every thing there, in reſpect of the country is great, and all little in reſpect of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:29522:71"/>Prince, and of thoſe of his blood. The preſence of them renders in ſome ſort all the reſt equal, which would not be ſo elſewhere, though it ſeem to be a place of great noiſe and confuſion, and that from thence proceed Thunder and Tempeſts, yet it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more ſecure being there, than in the places where they break. The Court at leaſt hath this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent property, that if it advance and raiſe not him who propoſes to follow it, it faſhions and breeds him, in reſpect that virtue is there in it's exaltation, and vice in the fall, for fear of appearing in view of the Prince.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXVII. Of the vices to which Courtiers are moſt ſubject, which are Vanity, Scoffing, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, Ambition, and Luxury.</head>
                  <p>THe moſt ordinary vices of Court, are Vanity, Scoffing, Diſſimulation, Ambition and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Vanity is properly a weakneſs or impotency of Soul, that cannot contain within our ſelves the good opinion that we have of our ſelves, whether it be, that the contentment which we receive from it, be too great for the ſmallneſs of the Veſſel which ſhould hold it, or that having received it, it is ſo weak that it muſt break to give vent to our Joy. Ladies and exploits of valour are the moſt common matter of Court-Vanity. Men that are in love perſuade themſelves that to keep it ſecret, is in ſome manner to ſmother the light of a bright fire, and that it is but a ſmall Joy, that hath no larger extent than the heart of thoſe that feel it. So that it is pretty difficult for the mouth of a young man to conceal a pleaſure wherein it hath had ſo great a ſhare. In the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:29522:72"/>acts of Valour, thoſe that are the Authors, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe afraid of not being ſufficiently ſeen, and that if Victory be dum, there will be but ſmall difference between the Victorious and the Vanquiſhed. And hence it is that both theſe Vanities do ſpring, though their principles be very different, the firſt proceeding from the impotency of a Soul that opens it ſelf and evaporates in the exceſs of it's pleaſure, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the weakneſs of a mean heart, which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures things according to the pain that it hath had, or the violence that it put upon it ſelf in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them. He eſteems them according to what they coſt him, and not according to their true worth, and this is the cauſe that we find always little Souls much more given to Vanity, than the great, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that whatever good thing they do, appears to them beyond their meaſure; when on the other hand great men who have a larger reach, and are always above their greateſt performances, contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within as great a modeſty as if they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed that they had not done enough: both theſe Vanities are no more but the ſound of a hollow or weak Veſſel, that deſerves rather deriſion than ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</p>
                  <p>Scoffing is another Court Vice, which ſprings on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a good opinion of our own parts and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency beyond others; if ſeeks it's own and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies divertiſement at the charge of ſome body. If it could be ſo modeſt to work it's effect ſoftly and gently without grating or wounding deep, I ſhould not think it altogether unprofitable in Society: when it is only Ingenious and Brisk, beſide that it ſerves to ſeaſon converſation, it's ſting is in ſome manner medicinal; that which is tart and biting in it, makeing ſometimes a more uſeful Impreſſion than a wiſe Counſel. It's freedom diſcovers to us many times an evil that we are ignorant of, which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:29522:72"/>a friend dares not touch; and cures it by making it known to us. To give it it's due, it ſhould not be thought very injurious but in the mouth of him that bears us ill will.</p>
                  <p>Diſſimulation is another vice of the Courtier, and nevertheleſs a Virtue of State, which hath need of that veil, as of a ſecond night, better to conceal the ſecrets of government: when a Courtier ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it to his private actions, that require not ſuch conduct as the publick, he makes it a particular Vice. It is a falſe reflexion of light, or to ſay bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, except in publick affairs it is only but the ape of politick prudence. It is a diſguiſe that puts a man into ſuch a Maſcarade, that the whole courſe of his Life is but one continued Lie. A lyar hath ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of truth, a diſſembler hath none, and moſt commonly he reſembles thoſe maskers that go about the ſtreets at <hi>Shrove-tide,</hi> who whether they be known or not, it is no great matter. Nevertheleſs diſtruſt always every man that walks under a Viſor, whatever his intention be, in that condition he gives ground to ſuſpect, that he is going, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the committing of ſome foul act. As to your ſelf, fix always your eyes on the ſpot to which you tend, go neither backward nor croſs-ways, leſt that thereby you may take the wrong rode. Amongſt great men themſelves diſſimulation makes but an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Vertue. <hi>Tiberius</hi> was but an indifferent Prince, though the moſt dangerous of all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours; And <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh hath neither been the greateſt nor beſt of our Kings. Both which were great artiſts in this ſtate-craft.</p>
                  <p>My children, be not at all afraid to make a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in your breaſt, you may perhaps amend a part of your Faults by the ſhame that you will have to ſee them expoſed to view. When men have once found that in all your actions there is nothing but
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:29522:73"/>Truth, Candour, and Ingenuity; if you meet with any affair where there is need of Mid-night ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, the opinion of the integrity of your Life paſt will render you inviſible in the managing of it.</p>
                  <p>As to Ambition, it is a vice ſo inherent in, and inſeparable from the nature of man, that there is no age, ſex nor quality that is free from it: but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the matter of it is more noble and large at Court, than any where elſe, I call it a Court-Vice, if an appetite in man to ſet himſelf forward ought to be called a Vice. It is true that if one could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways follow an honeſt courſe for his Preferment, Ambition would be rather a Vertue than Vice; but ſeeing the deſire of growing great is violent and precipitant, and that all means good or bad are made uſe of to attain to that end, for that reaſon it often degenerates into a vitious paſſion.</p>
                  <p>To ſay the truth, Ambition is the inward worm of a man of parts, which turns to a Bee in the ſoul of the virtuous, and a Waſp in the mind of the wicked. That paſſion hath ſome reſemblance to Choler which grows aduſt by being obſtructed, as the other becomes Malitious and Envious, when it meets with any hinderance in it's progreſs. It muſt needs be of a very blind and inconſiderate nature, that it can never find a reſting place, like birds whoſe eyes are put out, which fly always upward, becauſe they know not the place where they ſhould pearch.</p>
                  <p>It is very ſtrange, that ambition with all it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections preſerves ſtill the ſeeds of all the moſt lovely actions of Life. My ſon, that is but a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard iſſue, to give them a more illuſtrious and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful birth, we muſt have no other aim in doing of them, but the only reſpect to Virtue.</p>
                  <p>Luxury which chiefly conſiſts in the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Buildings, the beauty of furniture, the exceſs and delicacy of Food, the riches of Apparel
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:29522:73"/>and in a great retinue and attendance, may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter called the Pomp than a Vice of Court. All theſe things are ſo many refractions of Grandure, which appear crooked when they are not ſo. The courſe of that profuſion of ſtate flows ſecretly back and fore from the Country to the Court, and from the Court to the Country, as Rivers that fall in the Sea, which return again to their ſource to preſerve ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively themſelves and Sea in their juſt greatneſs, by wayes and channels unknown to us: without that reflux their ſource would quickly be dry or overgor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
                  <p>There is no State but ours that can ſupport that exceſſive charge, others cannot without ruining themſelves; this we ſee becauſe that in ſome all their pomp is ceremonial, and conſiſts only in the right and left hand, or in a certain kind of parade that lengthens only the tail without enlarging the wings. In others, they have the prudence not to ſuffer that the Prince ſhould always appear in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. This Eclipſe of his perſon is but in effect, the husbandry of a State which perceives it ſelf not able enough to carry out the ſplendour which ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accompany the Majeſty and preſence of the Prince.</p>
                  <p>As to other States that endeavour to imitate us in that exceſs, we may ſay of them that they are but our apes, conſidering the diſproportion of their ſtrength to ours. Our luxury is in ſome manner an image of the abundance of nature, which though it may ſuffer ſome waſt in it's flowers or fruit, leaves us always enough and to ſpare.</p>
                  <p>I will ſay farther, that Profuſion (without offence to our ſumptuary Laws) has in it ſomewhat of greater policy than Sparing, in that by the liberty that it gives to great men, who are naturally expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, to ruine themſelves, it leſſens their rents,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:29522:74"/>whereby their power by diſſipating it ſelf becomes leſs ſuſpect to the State. In effect all things rightly conſidered, I think luxury is a private evil and a publick good, in reſpect that by that means, goods only change hands, and that there is ſome diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice in that ſucceſſive revolution, which is one of the principal cauſes of the preſerving of the State.</p>
                  <p>My child, in the five things that I have hinted at, I have within a little reckoned up the moſt eſſential imperfections of the Court, others that are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there, are but tranſient faults; theſe are inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to it. Nevertheleſs whatſoever vices are found there, they are more excuſable in that place than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where elſe.</p>
                  <p>In the Country the moſt ordinary Vanity, is that of pedegree, which is but a reflexion of the light of our Fore-fathers. Scoffing is injurious there, diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation treacherous, ambition reſts in giving pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents or doles, and luxury barely in the table and keeping of days. Theſe defects having at Court more noble ſubjects to be applyed to, are there alſo more ſupportable.</p>
                  <p>If there was ever at Court a Vertue refin'd, and without any mixture of Vice it was that of the late Marquis of <hi>Senecy</hi> the Father: he was equally wiſe, valiant, learned and good, or to ſay better he was Vertuous in the ways of God and of the Court, which are two things not ſo eaſie to be reconciled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

                  <p>I Leave this illuſtrious example that I may return to you, my Son, and inform you that unleſs it be at Court, we can find nothing accompliſhed; nor any thing of a noble life; and therefore it is my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that you take the firſt ſhape and form of living in that place: I leave you but a ſmall eſtate to bear out the charges of a Court-life, you muſt run your hazard as I have done, fortune will have us pawn ourſelves in her Service. In the mean time you ſhall either get breeding or die in the Service; or if you grow old at Court or in the Army, the Court or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my will maintain you.</p>
                  <p>If you reap any advantage from your Services in the Army, which with the little eſtate that I leave you may make you able to ſubſiſt by your ſelf, let the King alone be your Maſter; engage not your fidelity to any beſides, leſt a time may come when your honour claſhing with your duty may call you to ſide with your benefactor.</p>
                  <p>Suffer your ſelf like the multitude to be ſurried by the torrents of Court, which are the Farourites. They are choſes by the King, either to affiſt him it carrying the burden of the ſtate, or to be the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of his ſecrets or pleaſures, or meetly to ſhow
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:29522:75"/>ſome work of his creation: on which ſoever of all theſe three accounts it be, they are by himſelf cut out as the images of his power, which you are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to reverence.</p>
                  <p>They who are in favour with their Prince, for their wiſdom in counſels and faithfulneſs in affairs are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſociates in the care of government, than fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites; the uſefulneſs of their Services, and the eaſe that the Prince thereby receives, ſhould make you honour and eſteem them, if you be a good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Strive, if you can to make your ſelf known to them, in reſpect that the eye of the Prince which is for moſt part vagrant and ranging among the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude will never attentively fix on you, whatſoever you may be, but by their means: but ſeeing that men and buſineſs run commonly in the ſame channel, the crowd is ſo great that way, that it becomes more eaſie to obtain acceſs to the Prince, than to his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: one muſt nevertheleſs uſe his endeavours to appear ſometime before them, though it be for no other end but to honour the choice of their Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>But then let your diſcretion keep you at due di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: if you approach too near them, or ſee them too often, you will burden their ſight and be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, and by preſſing too much upon them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of advancing forward ſet your ſelf back: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther look upon them at too great diſtance, nor too ſeldom, leſt you may put your ſelf out of their eye, and by your indifference do your ſelf prejudice.</p>
                  <p>As to thoſe who are the Confidents of the Kings ſecrets and pleaſures (whom I place in the ſecond rank, ſeeing that it is neceſſary that the care of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment take place of his Divertiſements) the grandeur of Kings would be uneaſie to them, if it deprived them of the ſweeteſt enjoyment of humane life, which is Friendſhip.</p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:29522:75"/>
                  <p>To make up a perfect Friendſhip, there muſt be ſome reſemblance of age, humour and quality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt friends. For the ſupplying of this laſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, which cannot (as the two former) be between a Prince and a Subject, Kings have judged it more convenient that they might have a ſhare in this pleaſant fruit of ſociety, to raiſe thoſe whom they have honoured with their friendſhip, to great places of ſtate, rather than to ſtoop down to them. In effect what is called Favour in a Prince toward his Subject, is the ſame thing as Friendſhip between two equals: there is nothing changed but the name.</p>
                  <p>Some ſpeculative heads have judged this elevation of a Subject dangerous, and that thereby there might happen ſome revolution in the State: there are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and examples <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con.</hi> Yet the more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber opinion, and as I think, the more politick, is that the King ſhould make choice of ſome perſon, in whoſe boſom he might power part of his Joy or Diſpleaſure, otherways the life of Kings would become a deſart in the midſt of the multitude. Seeing their paſſions are great as themſelves, it is ſo much the more neceſſary that they ſhould loſe part of their force, by imparting them to ſome faithful perſon, for fear that they diſcover not too much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence or weakneſs in their eruption; or that by keeping of them ſecret they breed not ſome peeviſh and melancholy humour, or ſome obſtruction of mind; whoſe ſymptomes are far more dangerous, than open wounds.</p>
                  <p>Hiſtory tells us that this profound retreat of Soul ſtupified the Judgment of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> ſurnamed the <hi>Hardy,</hi> a little before his death: and that the laſt years of <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his ſo reſerved a kind of life; were neither his wiſeſt nor moſt happy years.</p>
                  <p>Joy and heavineſs have this property, that being
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:29522:76"/>imparted to a faithful friend, the firſt is doubled and the laſt leſſened by a half. So then whatever can being ſerenity to the mind of the Prince, hath in it always much more good than evil, their private tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts being wont to become a publick ſtorm.</p>
                  <p>Yet I deny not alſo but that upon ſome other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations it were to be wiſhed that the Prince might preſerve his affections as his rank equal with all his ſubjects: but ſeeing that he is a man as we are, when his inclinations carry him to ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon, we ſhould, if we have any tenderneſs of heart, from our own experience excuſe in him, a paſſion that never appears in force but when it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed.</p>
                  <p>Above all things beware of that impertinent va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of not reverencing the Favourite, it is neither profitable, ſecure, nor honeſt; you cannot refuſe him honour, nor even your affection, ſeeing that he is the Confident of your Maſter, but that you break his image in your mind, and are guilty of internal felony againſt him.</p>
                  <p>The third kind of Favourites, is when a Prince raiſes any one without allowing him any ſhare in his counſels, pleaſures or confidence, he erects him meerly as a Coloſſus of greatneſs, that he may leave to the preſent age and poſterity a viſible monument of his power. Kings who are the image of God upon earth, are pleaſed ſometimes in imitation of him, to make of impure matter ſome work of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that may bear their Image: but as the works of the creature are more imperfect than thoſe of the creator, ſo they are of no duration, whether it be by reaſon of their inability to ſupport their own weight, or that the artiſt is aſhamed of his own workmanſhip, and like God, repents himſelf that he hath made man.</p>
                  <p>When that happens, my child, as I have adviſed</p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:29522:76"/>
                  <p>When that happens, my Child, as I have adviſed you to reverence the other Favorits, retain alſo ſome reſpect for the wracks of your Maſters follies; if you love him you are bound to conceal or excuſe them. The choice of a Favorite of any of theſe three kinds, is more honeſt in the middle Region than in the lower, and leſs dangerous than in the upper. There is never any falſe Idol of Sovereignty ſet up in that middle Region, and the Majeſty of the Prince is not thereby in the leaſt vilified.</p>
                  <p>I adviſe you moreover to conform your ſelf to the preſent ſtate of affairs, the direction of which is not in your power; condemn not what you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alter, and if your judgment find any thing in it amiſs, take heed at leaſt that your Tongue betray you not. You will labour in vain, if the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your mind be not concentric with the Wheels of the Times, their rapid motion will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yours along in ſpight of you, and will prove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to you in their revolution.</p>
                  <p>Be likewiſe of a more pliable diſpoſition than I have been; it is the beſt Gold that beſt obeys the Artiſts Hand, and of which the lovelieſt piece is made: the coarſer makes only more reſiſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's parts are not ſo ſolid as the others: aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your ſelf then, my Child, that every churliſh ſpirit is porous and uneven, and that if any good come of it, it proceeds rather from the excellence of the Workman, than of the matter.</p>
                  <p>It is to my ſelf that I ſpeak at preſent, who might have left you in legacy ſomething elſe beſide counſels; if I had had a ſpirit a little more flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. One may bow like the ruſh without remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crooked, and riſe again ſtreight in the ſame place as it doth, when the blaſt of Wind is over. I confeſs, my Children, that I have often wanted prudence in that; for which I can make no other
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:29522:77"/>excuſe for my juſtification towards you, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to you, that in getting the ſide of my fortune, I thought always that I followed that which was moſt for mine honour.</p>
                  <p>Here I am obliged to tell you that Honour aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as Devotion, has its ſcruples, and that it is very hard for one ſo to conduct himſelf in refining of either, that he admit no mixture of ſuperſtition. Wherefore it is my opinion that the thread and texture of your honour ſhould be ſomewhat coarſe: when it is too thin and fine, its tenderneſs ſhapes out too much work for the maintaining of it.</p>
                  <p>If ſuperſtition in honour be excuſable, it ought only to be in the actions of War; except in theſe, it is our greateſt glory to be moſt condeſcending in ſociety, and moſt ſociable in converſation. Be not abuſed by the vain phantome of I know not what falſe generoſity, which is only ſuperficial. I have often obſerved, that thoſe who make the greateſt clutter about it, are for moſt part all neceſſitous, and who hazard nothing but rags and words in the profeſſion of it.</p>
                  <p>Make it never your buſineſs to introduce a new Faſhion, the wiſe are rarely the authors of them. Neither condemn thoſe that are in uſe; if they continue, follow them; if they alter, change with them; in matters indifferent, and whereat no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is offended, there is more extravagance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, than judgment, in being ſingular.</p>
                  <p>It is enough for a wiſe man to retire from the crowd, as to the inſide, and to preſerve to himſelf the liberty of judging within himſelf of matters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are: but as to the outſide, he muſt enter into the common uſe of received forms. Publick ſociety is in a manner offended at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal revolt of a particular perſon, though in a thing indifferent. Beſides our mutual aſſiſtance,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:29522:77"/>we owe it our conſent and imitation of its cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, yea even though in them there may be ſome folly.</p>
                  <p>If the Mode will have you to wear more cloth in a looſe or leſs in a cloſe-bodied Coat; and that your Shoes be longer than your Feet, do ſo; but I pray you let them not be too ſtreight, the ſlaſhes that you give them, cry againſt you murther, and the Ribbons with which you tie them are not at all becoming in that place. Uſe not your ſelf like a criminal by putting your ſelf to a Rack, from whence you can reap nothing but vexation, bunches and the Gout. Let your Periwig or Hair be long and well powdered and your Shoulders too, if the Faſhion will have it ſo, I am not againſt it, only I beg of you that you employ not ſo much time for the ornament of the outſide of your Head; that you reſerve not to your ſelf ſtill ſome hours for the ordering of the inſide.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXIX. Of Divertiſements that conſiſt in Play, and in Converſation. Of the Play of Cheſs, Dice and Cards, and of Play in General.</head>
                  <p>I Think, my Children, that I have now handled the principal Actions of Mans Life except that of Divertiſements, whereof the moſt common are Play and Converſation. Plays which are not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary, as Tennis, Hand-Ball, Pel-Mel, and the like, are rather Exerciſes than Plays, which Men love or ſlight according to their Age, their Fitneſs and Diſpoſition, or according as they are addicted to them. All the hurt that exceſs in theſe can do, is to tire the Body without much troubling the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:29522:78"/>Mind or Purſe. The Sedentary ſuch as the Cheſs, Dice, and Cards, are more dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Though Cheſs have in it ſomewhat ingenious, yet ſeeing it abſtracts us too much from our ſelves, and that the Victory is but vain to the Gainer and makes the Loſer fretful, and that it is ſo dreaming a Paſtime, that it ſeems to be the ſleep of two men that are awake; ſince you have the World and Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety to make a proof of your ſufficiency in, I adviſe you, not to reduce it to ſo narrow a Precinct. That is an attracting Play becauſe that the pleaſure of every action conſiſts in the end, and that this is ſuddain, depending on our own conduct alone, and is often reiterated; all which conditions do hardly meet in any other action whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>The Play at Dice is not a Divertiſement, it is rather an attempt made upon anothers Purſe, which the Law tolerates becauſe it cannot hinder. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſuffer your ſelf to be infected with this abomination; Look, I pray you, into the Places and Ordinaries of this unlucky Commerce, and there conſider the trouble and agitation of thoſe that haunt them, the diſturbance of the Winners, the deſpair of Loſers, the Curſes, and Blaſphemies that there are uttered, and I aſſure my ſelf that all theſe terrible Images will fill you will horror a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Though the Hits of that Play are all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany, and entertained with the diverſe repriſes of hope and fear, the Mind ſuffers a continual tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture under the Wheel of theſe two Paſſions; beſide that of Fortune.</p>
                  <p>Cards and Tables are ſomewhat more moderate: for as the Progreſs of their action is ſlower, ſo the motion that they cauſe in the Mind, is more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. In theſe Games Fortune decides one part of the ſucceſs, and leaves the other to our conduct. So that it is the moſt ordinary Divertiſement of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:29522:78"/>thoſe that want buſineſs, or deſire ſome relaxation from affairs, which in it ſelf would be honeſt and lawful, if there were no cheating in the caſe: but ſeeing that Game is a kind of Exchequer, from whence Luxury draws part of its ſtock, and that all men would ſpend more than they are able, hence it is that there is but little honeſty in a Commerce from which every one hopes to reap advantage.</p>
                  <p>Play is a kind of contract, which hath its forms only in uſe and cuſtom: Fortune is the Judg, but the management and conduct is all our own, which ought to be ſo much the more ſincere, that we are obliged to obey its rules by an unwritten Law. He that did violate it, was heretofore held as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous, whom one might upbraid as a man taken in open Robbery: now adays it is no ſhame to be a Cheat in Play, ſo great is the proſtitution of Publick Faith that it is now no more the Trade of a beggarly Knave, there are Perſons of Quality that openly and ſecurely practiſe it, becauſe it is not eaſie to bring them to reaſon.</p>
                  <p>So that, my Son, I ſhould be glad that you would renounce this Divertiſement, which is altogether oppoſite to Charity, in that it grieves either your ſelf, or Adverſary who loſes. If you cannot abſtain from it, be at leaſt, I pray you, more patient than I have been, and as faithful to your Gameſter.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXX. Of Converſation.</head>
                  <p>COnverſation is the moſt common and honeſt Divertiſement of Life. Solitary retreat would be ſomewhat too ghaſtly, and the Croud too tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mu tuary, if there were not ſome mean betwixt
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:29522:79"/>both made up of the choice of ſome particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with whom men communicate themſelves, to avoid the tediouſneſs of ſolitude, or the burden of the multitude. That choice is made according to the diverſity of tempers, every one fitting his Buckle to his Belt, and in this variety all propoſe the ſame end which is the divertiſement of the Mind.</p>
                  <p>As every Week hath its working days and day of Reſt, ſo after the painful hours that are ſpent at home and abroad, every day hath need of its hours of repoſe, which are the hours of converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. wherefore we ſhould have a care not to miſtake in the choice of thoſe with whom we contract fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, in reſpect that the laſt ſeaſoning of our manners whether good or bad depends thereon.</p>
                  <p>There is no ſociety in the Croud, the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of men whom we meet there, make no more impreſſion on us than the Faces that we ſee in a Dream: the ſound of their Voices is not much more articulated than the noiſe of falling waters. The mind in that tumult finds no ſupport: If it be likewiſe alone, inſtead of pleaſing, it ſtuns it ſelf in its own career: there is nothing then but the preſence of one or more friends that comforts it. It is indeed moſt certain that the diſcloſing of our hearts to ſome particular friend cures it of part of its anxiety: but ſeeing the converſation with more friends requires a greater enlargement of our mind, we divide our ſelves more amongſt them, and by conſequent diſcharge more fully our troubles.</p>
                  <p>God did me the favour when I was at Court, twenty ſix years ago, that I was received into a converſation, which was chiefly entertained by two brothers of the ſame name, merit, and illuſtrious Life. There was every evening in their houſe a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:29522:79"/>certain conſort of friends, where all things paſt with ſuch harmony, and ſo much ſweetneſs and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I never had any trouble in mind which vaniſhed not in that company.</p>

Now ſuch a kind of converſation, beſide that it quiets and ſtills our paſſions, it enlightens likewiſe the mind: for it will be certainly in vain to fill the magazin of the mind by meditation, if we vent it not by ſpeech. And therefore we commonly ſee good reaſons loſe their force and grace for want of a clear expreſſion, which depends only on the turning about, and ſetting in order the notions of the mind before they be expreſſed; converſation embodies them by ſpeech, and we ſee them better then, than when they are ſtill ſhapeleſs in our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; and therefore it is that men for moſt part pronounce aloud what they read or write; words admitting of a more diſtinct judgment than thoughts.</p>
                  <p>In converſation, methinks, that men alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſome union with thoſe to whom they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate themſelves, and that we feel the ſame effect that appears in natural actions, which not only fortifie themſelves by their conjunction, but better reſiſt contrary impreſſions. Mankind is a body compoſed of ſimilary and diſſimilary parts, which is divided into as many portions as there are men. The Similary Parts by their approach en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reunite themſelves: And the Diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, to maintain their ſcparation by flight: for from whence can proceed the love, or averſion that we find at firſt meeting, if the intimation of that caſual impulſe were not inherent in the maſs of blood, and the ſpirits where it is occaſioned.</p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:29522:80"/>
                  <p>It is very conſiderable that there paſſes nothing in the intellectual nature, whereof the material gives us not ſome indication. For example the eye is better ſatisfied to joyn the eye, the hand the hand, and the mouth the mouth, than any other part of the body. After the ſame manner we find amongſt Spirits and Humours ſome ſimilary parts which have ſo great affection for one another, that by the ſole difference of their ſorting together, what diverſity ſoever there may be in the maſs, we may make a certain judgement of a man according to the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation wherein he delights. The ſerious covet the company of the ſerious, fools of the brainſick, the gentle tempers the quiet of a corner: but diſcreeter perſons deſire an innocent and pleaſing ſociety which forms the mind and diverts it. There is none but the company of ſeveral friends who make all profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of honour and integrity, that can have all theſe conditions. Keep to this laſt, my ſon, and prefer it to all the reſt.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXXI. Of the Conditions neceſſary for a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</head>
                  <p>I Have formerly declared my intention that one of my Sons ſhould be a Church-man, provided he were endued with the conditions and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neceſſary for that charge. My ſecond Son, I think, will be the fitteſt for it; for I find him of a temper more debonnaire and tractable than the reſt. And as the ſacrifice of a Son is more acceptable to God, than that of a Lamb, I will not make my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation a Sacriledge, by preſenting to him the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecteſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:29522:80"/>of my Children. Though they be yet too young to diſcern which of them will be the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, yet I deſign him who ſeems to be ſo at preſent, whether it be the mildneſs of his infancy that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges liges me to it, or that I have already a reſpect to that holy Character wherewith I deſire he may be honoured.</p>
                  <p>My eldeſt and youngeſt Sons, are of too brisk and hot a temper, for a Profeſſion that requires meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the conſtitution of their brother appears more moderate, and to have ſome ſign alſo of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er judgment; ſo that I think in dedicating him to the Service of God, I offer him the ſoundeſt fruit of my Family. It is greater injury to God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto him the refuſe of the Houſe, than to offer him a Sheep that hath a blemiſh; in reſpect that the Sacrificer ought to be more pure than the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. That is juſt as to make the Shew-Bread of the Siftings of the Flower, and to pollute the Sanctuary of the Lord with the impurity of our Blood.</p>
                  <p>The Platonick Laws require of thoſe that aſpire to the Prieſt-hood, that they ſhould be lawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, ſound in Body and Manners, of an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and honeſt extraction, virtuous perſons; and that afterward the hand of God ſhould make the choice by giving them their preferment by Lot. The Canons of the Church agree in all theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, except the Election by Lot, which they have judged too blind and caſual for ſo worthy an Employment: and foraſmuch as the imperfections of the Soul are more hidden than the defects of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which are obvious to the Eye, they have been prudently circumſpect in their inquiry and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and in not permitting that any ſhould be honoured with that Dignity before a certain age, and without evident proofs of Learning and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29522:81"/>of Manners; and have therefore appointed Orders to be conferred ſucceſſively one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the end that during that progreſs it might be known if the perſon to be admitted were not guilty of ſomewhat that might render him incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that holy Character which ſeparates him from the Laics and conſecrates him to the portion of God which is the Clergy, from whence there is no return.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hardowin,</hi> my Son, when you have attained to the years of diſcretion, enter into your ſelf, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate maturely with your Manners and Paſſions, which will then be in their vigour, if they can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to lead the Life of a good Church-man. It is better that you ſhould be a bad Lay-man, than a vitious Prieſt. The reverence toward God and the ſcandal of your Neighbour will therein be leſs: Conſider likewiſe, if you be ſufficiently inſtructed in the matters of your Profeſſion, the Lord preſerve you from that ſhame and confuſion, that any one ſhould be in doubt when you approach to the Foot of the Altar whether you be the Sacrifice or Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer.</p>
                  <p>You muſt likewiſe, my Son, be a lover of Books or renounce your Profeſſion. Study is one of the chief exerciſes of a Church-man; for beſide that it ſerves to inſtruct himſelf and others, it ſerves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to divert him from idleneſs; his Prayers are ſhort, and the day long, if he employ not his time in Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, what will he be elſe, but an empty ground, that is expoſed, <hi>Vitiorum primo occupanti,</hi> to the firſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſour of his Vices?</p>
                  <p>Employ your Studies in endeavouring like the ancient Fathers to become more knowing in poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Divinity than in Scholaſtick, the one makes the Maſter, the other but the Scholar. The poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is humble, dutiful, and full of the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:29522:81"/>the Scholaſtick is ſubject to be headſtrong; arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, and ſo full of contention, that very often it puts out Charity.</p>
                  <p>A certain perſon hath ſaid more judiciouſly, I think, than malitiouſly, that it hath been hatched by the idleneſs of ſome Monkiſh ſpirits, who were indeed ſubtil, but having had more fire than light, would have reduced Theology to an Art, by ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting it to the forms of Logick, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath done all his Works. From thence is derived that Deluge of Arguments, Queſtions, Objections and Diſtinctions (great indeed in bulk, but ſmall in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) whereof the moſt part are of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and where there is neither Bottom nor Bank.</p>
                  <p>The Poſitive conſiſts ſimply in the Word of God, in the Expoſition of it according to the Fathers, and in the underſtanding of the Myſteries of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion according to Faith. The Scholaſtick mingles with it ſo many vain Subtilties, and ſo much Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydery of leſs value than the Stuff, that hardly can the ancient Texture of it be known. My Son, the buſineſs is to labour for our Salvation in the reading of holy Books. So long as you buſie your ſelf to reaſon of God, and his Attributes, have a care that you miſtake not the way that you muſt follow to guide you to him.</p>
                  <p>In primitive times he that deſired to be a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſt, was obliged to reſign all his Goods and to lay them at the Apoſtles Feet. It was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at that time that the primitive Zeal ſhould make up a common ſtock for the uſe of the Faithful and Poor: but now adays when there remains little more but the Smoak of that ancient Heat, and that the Manners of Men are changed, the honour of Prieſt-hood requires that he that undertakes it, ſhould have a ſufficient ſubſiſtance.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:29522:82"/>
                  <p>If God beſtow upon you, my Son, ſomewhat more than is neceſſary to maintain you decently in the rank that you may have in the Church, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it amongſt the Poor. They that live in the place where your Benefices (if any you have) lie, have the firſt priviledg: your Relations and thoſe of your Blood, if they be neceſſitous, the ſecond: and afterward the reſt of the Poor according to your ability. Govern your ſelf nevertheleſs with ſo much wiſdom in that Economy, that you ſend not ſo much nouriſhment to the Branches, as may exhauſt the Sap of the Stock.</p>
                  <p>My Child, if you would entirely dedicate your ſelf to the Service of God, I have an advice to give you, which is more Apoſtolick than Religious Vows; render your ſelf capable of the charge of a good Parſon or Curate. For that end you muſt renounce all ſort of impurity of Fleſh and of Spirit, be ſubmitted to your Superiors, and be no more your own man, but give your ſelf wholly to all the Souls committed to your charge, which is the loweſt abnegation that you can make of your ſelf, and the moſt illuſtrious purity to which you can attain.</p>
                  <p>When I hear men ſpeak of the Life of ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Parſons heretofore deceaſed and of ſome ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, I think that in their actions I ſee a living Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of the greateſt Purity that hath ever been in Chriſtendom. They Pray, they Practiſe, they Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techize, Confeſs, Preach, they diſtribute their Goods amongſt the Poor, they comfort the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, they viſit the Sick, far and near, night and day, at what hour ſoever they be called, a foot; and give them the Sacrament; they aſſiſt them at their Death, and what danger ſoever there may be, accompany them to the Grave, and perform to them the Office of Funeral. They are all to all in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular as well as in general. The holy Apoſtles
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:29522:82"/>and Jeſus Chriſt himſelf did no more, except the working of Miracles, which was rather an effect of their being viſited by the Holy Ghoſt, than of their Character.</p>
                  <p>As we are touched with reverence at the happy meeting of ſuch holy Perſons, we ſhould likewiſe be with horror, when we ſee any that neglect the Souls of the Faithful committed to them, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don theſe Apoſtolick Functions which are their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for any other employment whatſoever, unleſs it be the ſervice of the King and State; ſuch perſons will hardly prove more faithful to man than God, their firſt breaking warrants them in the ſecond. God preſerve you, my Son, if you be called to that holy charge, from doing any thing that may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the purity of ſo ſacred and holy a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXXII. Five general Directions for Virtue, whereof the laſt is Submiſſion to the Providence of God, which makes the concluſion of the Second Part.</head>
                  <p>MY deareſt Children, if it behove me to make a review of all the particulars which may conduce to the faſhioning your Body and Mind, I ſhould never make an end. I have only therefore touched thoſe things which I thought moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for you, and wherein you ought to take great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt care to improve your ſelves. There is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry which languiſhes not by neglect, nor ſtrength that becomes not weakneſs when nummed or ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified. Virtue will not have its Action put off till
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29522:83"/>to morrow: that delay is nothing but a modeſt complement that an irreſolute ſoul makes to it ſelf, which hath neither the power to grant nor refuſe what reaſon requires.</p>
                  <p>Your active and working temper is a rude and unpoliſhed diligence, that ſtands in need only of a wiſe direction; this is the effect of Virtue alone, the ſeries of which that is made up of all occaſions and all kinds of matter, expoſes to view the lovely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Lives of the Illuſtrious. Virtue is not the work of an hour, a year, of one or more actions, it requires our whole life, it is always beginning and it's progreſs ſhould be ſo continued that it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not the liberty of judging thereof till after death. It is true that the purchaſe of it is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but ſeeing that difficulty makes matter for it, the greater that is, the more noble will be its actions.</p>
                  <p>The hardeſt Marble fruſtrates not the hand of the Statuary, but by the difficulty of ſhaping of it into form his diligence is doubled. Virtue is only inacceſſible to thoſe that look upon it at diſtance, ſuch as have a heart to approach it, find it's avenues eaſie enough: it conſiſts only in four or five general points.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is never to be idle. The fore part of man bends all forwards: the hands, feet, and face, to teach us that the Mind ſhould conform to the Fabrick of the Body, and be progreſſive as it is. Let us not ſuffer thoſe two parts of our Body to loyter in lazineſs and ſloth: we find that we weary ſooner ſtanding ſtill than walking, and that the beſt ſpirits are like the ſtrongeſt arms, which are far ſooner put out of joynt by beating the Air than ſtriking on a reſiſtable Matter.</p>
                  <p>So that Action being more commodious to us than Reſt, let us apply our ſelves to ſomething.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:29522:83"/>The Head without the Hands and Feet is a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to ſhew us that we muſt determine our ſelves to action, and that whatſoever delicateneſs there may be in our words and thoughts, if we employ our ſelves in nothing elſe, we appear like the winged heads of thoſe little Cherubims, which are ſo much the more imperfect, in that they are neither Angels nor Men; as an Ape is deformed, becauſe it is of an ambiguous nature betwixt a Beaſt and a Man.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Method of preparing and plaining the ways of Virtue, is to be watchful, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider if in whatſoever we do or ſay we propoſe an honeſt end, and take honeſt ways to attain it. If we be aſſiduous in that obſervation, and in that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our ſelves, we ſhall without doubt inſenſibly mount to the top of Virtue, without being much incommoded or hindred by the ſteepneſs of it's aſcent; for though the affairs of the World, have many times crooks and knots which ſeem to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them to ſome indirect circumſtances which may divert us from the right road that we muſt keep in managing of them: Nevertheleſs if our will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue firm and immoveable towards a good end, and that the biaſſes that we take to arrive at it be likewiſe honeſt; we may aſſure our ſelves that the imperfection of the matter will be redreſſed by the integrity of the Workman. It is impoſſible to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on all things by a ſtreight line: buſineſs like ways have their turnings and windings, which of neceſſity we are obliged to follow, otherwiſe we ſhould make in both but a bad progreſs.</p>
                  <p>The moſt important ſecret of life is to have pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and skill honeſtly and lawfully to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date Virtue to times, men and affairs; for by that means we not only ſweeten what is moſt harſh and auſtere in it, but likewiſe give it the beſt and moſt commodious uſe that it can have.</p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:29522:84"/>
                  <p>My Third Advice is, that when you have moſt carefully obſerved your ſelf, you likewiſely atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively conſider the actions of others. All the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Man are good or bad; for the greateſt part of thoſe that we call indifferent, are not ſo, they are rather the marks of, or prediſpoſitions which tend to good or evil. If you exactly conſider both, the good will furniſh you with an example of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and the bad with a better example to make you abhor and deteſt them. Aſſure your ſelf, my Son, that the faults that are committed in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, have in them a more certain corrective, than what proceeds from your own eſcapes.</p>
                  <p>The Features of anothers Face which appears di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to our eyes, make a more lively impreſſion in us, than our own, which are not ſeen of us but by reflexion, other Mens vices are conſidered naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are in themſelves. Our perturbation (for there is no Vice without perturbation) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the appearances of our own, and hinders us from ſeeing of them in their uglieſt ſhape: from whence it comes to paſs that when there is a calm in our minds again, we retain no more of them but an imperfect Image, the kindneſs that we have for our ſelves, which reacheth not to others, blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of our memory a part of their deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>My fourth Counſel is, that every night before you go to reſt, you make a ſhort recollection of all that you have ſeen, done, and ſaid during the day; this tryal not only inflames the foul with the love of good, and the hatred of evil, but ſerves alſo as a memorandum for the conduct of the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>It is not juſt that we ſhould give the whole night to the repoſe of the Body, and the digeſtion of the Victuals, wherewith it hath been loaded in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:29522:84"/>the day time, and refuſe half an hour only or leſs to the Soul, for the concoction of good actions, and the evacuation of it's impurities.</p>
                  <p>By this recollection Virtue ferments and ſwells; and Vice diſſolves; it is of ſo excellent an uſe, that ſome of the very Ancients, though they were not illuminated by the Light of the Faith, have made it one of the chief Articles of their Morality. Let us not ſuffer, my Son, that they ſhould have been more careful than we in an exerciſe ſo neceſſary for the ſalvation, and conduct of the Soul of a Believer.</p>
                  <p>I will conclude this ſecond Part, and my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels concerning Virtue, by the laſt of the four which the Divine and unimitable <hi>Thomas a Kempis</hi> directs for obtaining peace in the Mind. His three firſt Counſels, to wit, to affect rather to do the will of another than ones own, to covet always the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place, and to deſire rather too little than too much, are of a higher perfection than I wiſh you to have.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three which are Virtues in a retired Life, are imperfections in the order of Society, which requires that every one keep the rank of his Parts and Quality. As to the Fourth, which is to ſubmit our ſelves in all things to the Will of God, this laſt does really crown all the Virtue of Man; it will be in vain for you to be diligent in well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to obſerve your ſelf in your actions, to draw inſtruction from the Actions of others, and to make an examination of your Conſcience; if your mind ſubmit not to the events of life which are not in your power, and your will be not entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Will of God, the reſt will ſtand you in no ſtead. The loſs of Friends, Goods, Health, Croſſes in our Deſigns, and a thouſand other trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome accidents, come all upon us by an eternal decree: and in reſpect that our eye and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:29522:85"/>are too weak to trace ſtep for ſtep the connexion that all theſe things have with the Providence of God, we eſteem them caſual.</p>
                  <p>Let us not abuſe our ſelves, my Children, there is nothing in the world caſual, Providence orders the ſmalleſt aſwel as greateſt things; a grain of duſt, a Gnat have their dependance on God aſwel as Men and Angels, every one in their ſeveral order, there is no event how ſmall ſo ever but hath it's cauſe, and that cauſe it's dependence on another cauſe till we come to the firſt.</p>
                  <p>So, my Child, if all things come to paſs by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, he that gives it, intends nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; or riſe all things happen for the beſt, if not in reſpect of you, yet in reference to the Univerſe, the intereſt of which takes place of yours: you cannot then be afflicted with any croſs accident, but that your mind is in open rebellion againſt him who is the cauſe of it. To avoid that, I charge you, my deareſt Children, Sons and Daughters, to ſubmit your ſelves to the obedience of God, and to deſire that in all things his Will be done rather than your own.</p>
                  <p>There is no ſofter lenitive to ſweeten the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the croſs accidents of life, which depend not on us, than conſtantly to believe that they are the effects of the providence of God which come upon us by his order. By ſo doing the neceſſity that lies upon us of bearing of them, will be eaſily changed into a complacency to his Will: by accommodating our ſelves to his pleaſure, there will nothing from thence forward happen to us in ſpight of us, and we do not only a thing that is pleaſing to him, but become in ſome manner participant of his eternal Counſel, to which it ſeems we ſubſcribe by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, when it goes along with his.</p>
                  <p>In effect it is a moſt groſs miſtake to imagine that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:29522:85"/>all the adventures of our life are guided by a blind power, it is God, and not that, who leads us. Whither? to himſelf. Which way? inquire not, your guide is not obliged to give you an account of the way he takes, let it content you that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty is your guide. This is very ſtrange in the vaſt extent of the Ocean, where there is neither Path nor Road, man commits himſelf blindly to the faith of a Pilot, who hath no other direction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make his courſe round the World, but his Compaſs and a Star; and in the Revolution of Life he can hardly confide in the providence of him, who is not only the Creator of that Star, but the mover of the Univerſe, in the conduct whereof it is impoſſible that he can be miſtaken, becauſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Founder thereof, all it's ways are known to him.</p>
                  <p>Daſh out of your mind then, I pray you, my Son, that vain name of <hi>Fortune,</hi> which is an empty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition, that hath its being only in the fooliſh imagination of man: pronounce not ſo much as the name of it, leſt that by forming the word you grave not a falſe Idol of a thing that is not, and by attributing to it any kind of power, you rob not the Divinity. Conſider whither your error leads you, when you cannot comprehend the order of the World, nor the connexion of it's cauſes; under the name of Fortune, you transfer your own blindneſs to their Mover. Although you cannot follow within diſtance the contiguity of events, whereof the effect of the one is the cauſe of the other, yet for all that they have an eternal and immutable princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, from whence that order is derived. Content your ſelf to be meaſured by it, without calling in queſtion the rule of the Meaſurer. Univerſal and particular things are linked together, without any the leaſt confuſion. The laſt Wave that beats the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:29522:86"/>Shore, receives the ſame common impulſe with the reſt of the Ocean. According to that general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, it ought to be no ſmall contentment to man, to ſee that the ſame order that makes the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire revolution of the Univerſe, is at the ſame time the cauſe of his.</p>
                  <p>Add this then, my Children, to the Articles of your Faith, [That God does all for the beſt.] It is as true as the reſt, more ſutable to your reaſon, and of larger uſe; in ſo much that if you be once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of this truth, it will be to you an internal Haven, where you may ride ſecure from all the Tempeſts of Life.</p>

                  <p>GOd having had the goodneſs, my Children, to make Man after his own Image, and to multiply his kind, we cannot, I think, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that reſemblance that reſemblance that is betwixt him and us, if man behave not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf toward Man, like a God; that is to ſay, unleſs he be good and beneficent to him. In the Firſt Part of theſe my Counſels, I have handled the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Man towards God: In the Second, his Duty
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:29522:87"/>towards Himſelf which depends on the moderation of his Paſſions. This Third Part, which conſiſts in the reſpective Duty of Man toward Man, is nothing elſe but a lawful application of theſe two firſt Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties towards his Neighbour: for it is moſt certain that every man that fears God, and conforms his Will to Reaſon, will prove a good Husband, good Father, good Son, good Brother, good Maſter, good Servant, good Neighbor, good Citizen, good Subject, and good Prince, which are the chief links of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society.</p>
                  <p>It hath been ſaid by one, with very little judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that to lead a retired Life, one muſt be more than man or leſs than man, becauſe I have never heard of a Heroe that became ſo in ſolitude, there is more probability to think that the avoiding of company proceeds only from the lubbardlineſs of a rude and ruſtick ſoul, buried in matter, which want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force to puſh it ſelf out into the world, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires to hide its own infirmity. And if the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent zeal have exhibited to us ſome virtuous Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, they are ſo few in number, and the imitation hath been ſo difficult that, that perfection hath not been able to deſcend to us. If there remain any image of it at this day, it is in the retreat of the <hi>Carthuſian</hi> Monks. It is true that every one of them has his Cell apart, yet to compenſate in ſome ſort the auſterity of their Rule, their inſtitution ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points that of twenty four hours, whereof day and night is compoſed, they ſhould employ ten in the Church by intervals, and thereby entertain a mutual ſociety in the exerciſe and duties of their worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Man is of ſo ſociable a nature, that for want of company, if he be in the night time alone in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart without light, the preſence of a Dog, a Horſe, a Bird, or of an Infant in the Swadling Cloaths, is able to leſſen his fear, and it may be it was for that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:29522:87"/>reaſon that the Beaſts and other living Creatures were created before him. The flight of a rout, the purſuit of a Victory, panick terrours, the flocking of eleven thouſand Virgins, and fourty thouſand men to martyrdom, are ſo many different effects that proceede only from the force that a blind impreſſion of ſociety makes in the mind, which is ſometime ſo uniform in its action, that a whole multitude ſeems to be governed by one ſingle ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When two or three of you ſhall be gathered together in my name, I will be in the midſt of you,</hi> (ſaid our Lord) to oblige man to ſome ſociety. He promiſes not the ſame grace to man alone; for though a man by himſelf may love God with all his ſtrength, yet his charity is imperfect, in that it is defective in the officious part of it's duty, which is the love of our Neighbor; wherein is comprehended the mutual duty of man towards man, which is the laſt thing that I have propoſed to my ſelf to treat of in this Will and Teſtament.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Of the firſt Society, which is that of Husband and Wife, and of their reſpective Duties.</head>
                  <p>I Shall then begin this laſt part by the firſt Society in the World which was made by the hand of God himſelf, and that is the conjunction of Man and Wife, whereof all the circumſtances are very conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>Before that the Woman was made, <hi>God faw</hi> (ſaith the Scripture) <hi>that it was not good for Man to be alone;</hi> for when he is alone he is many times the greateſt enemy that he hath, and of whom he ſhould be moſt aware. Afterward he ſaid, that he
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:29522:88"/>would give him an help meet for him: betwixt two things that are meet for one another, the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience ought to be equal and reciprocal, which gives us an evidence that the Woman ſhould neither be the Miſtreſs nor the Servant of the Man, otherwiſe they could not be meet for one another.</p>
                  <p>Before that he gave her to him he caſt him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, to teach us perhaps that we have no need of our eyes on that occaſion, and that they are often enough very bad Counſellors in the choice of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient good, and that it is alſo altogether neceſſary that the mind ſhould be ſetled and in repoſe before we take a Wife; for if in the matter of Marriage covetouſneſs poſſeſs and trouble the Mind, or we be pre-engaged in any other love, we can very hardly make a good choice.</p>
                  <p>The Woman was neither taken out of the Back nor the Fore-part of Man, but out of his Side, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed for his Companion and equal. The Scripture obſerves not out of what ſide ſhe was taken, to the end that ſhe might take the right, that is to ſay, the conduct of the Family, if ſhe be more capable of it than the Husband.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Woman is made of the ſame Skin. Bone, Fleſh, and Blood, as the Man is, to the end that both may know that there cannot be a more ſtrict union in nature than is betwixt them. The knowledg of their duty ſhould be ſo perfect, that it muſt appear like a Cement, which joyns Obedience ſo well with Command, that it can hardly be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed who commands and who obeys.</p>
                  <p>With the good leave of the Doctors, the diviſion which they have made of a Family into two parts, to wit, the Man, and the Goods, and Poſſeſſion, ſeems to me very imperfect, if we add not a third, to wit, the Wife; ſeeing that man cannot propagate Poſterity but only by her means, nor transfer his
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:29522:88"/>Eſtate unleſs to the uncertain pillage of others, if ſhe give him not a lawful Poſſeſſor. So that the denomination of the Family ſhould have been taken from the Wife; in reſpect that the principal parts that conſtitute it, cannot be governed with good order and economy, if ſhe take not upon her the direction.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, my deareſt Children, I give you my advice, that you take the greateſt care imaginable in the choice of a Wife, as being the moſt important action of all your Life. If you be cheated in the goodneſs of a Horſe, in the price of a Houſe, or any thing elſe, you are not wedded to them, you may turn them off when you are weary of them: but in chooſing of a Wife, you engage in a contract, which can only be annulled by death.</p>
                  <p>Would ye chooſe her well? conſider rather the purity than Antiquity of her Blood; and the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and good manners rather than the Honours and Dignities of her Race. The imperfections of Body and Mind are hereditary evils whoſe contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as we often ſee) skips from the Grand-father, and Great Grand-father, to the Grand-children; if it ſleep in ſome generation, it is rather a Ceſſation and Truce than Peace, which will not be of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
                  <p>Marry not too young, the firſt man was in a ſtate of perfection before the Woman was given him. You ſee that men never take the ſeed of a green Apple nor the grain of Corn that is in the Bud or Flower for Planting or Sowing. A Body that is but looſe and half faſtened, whereof the firſt ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Blood are but as yet Froth and Scum, can produce nothing capable of perfection. The Laws which deny you the diſpoſal of your Eſtate before a certain Age of majority, ſeem tacitly to ſuſpend you Marriage until that Age; otherwiſe you would
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:29522:89"/>marry before the ſeaſon. It is unſeemly to have a Houſewife before you have the power of a Houſe to commit to her management. Seeing that the Body and Soul enter both in the compoſition of Man, the maturity of the Body is not ſufficient for that effect, you muſt likewiſe expect the ripeneſs of the Soul, which is not ſuppoſed to be, until you be of Age. I beg pardon of our Lawgivers, they have left us a juſt ſuſpicion of their incontinence, by by giving us permiſſion to marry ſooner.</p>
                  <p>As I adviſe you not to marry, until you be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what advanced in years, ſo if you would find an help meet for you, court not one either that is too young; let the verdure of her tender years grow up to maturity under the care of a wiſe Mother, and the virtuous modeſty of her virginity, before you preſent your ſelf to gather the fruit. You will know better when the ſeaſon is come, if it be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or not, than if it were as yet but green. What aſſiſtance can you expect to find in an age that is not ripe enough to underſtand what is its duty? She muſt learn that under the modeſt name of Maiden: For if ſhe hath once got the name of Wife, it will be then too late; for that is a name of Authority, but the other of Maid, a name of fear and ſubmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>In vain ſhould the firſt Woman have been given to Man by the hand of God when both were in moſt perfect age; if it had not been fitteſt for their comfortable living together. The man was made before the woman, to teach us that the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhould be oldeſt, but it was only a very ſhort time, to give us likewiſe to underſtand, that there ſhould not be betwixt them too great a difference of age. When the one is much older than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſuch a match is rather a common hinderance to both, than a convenient and mutual help; ſince
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:29522:89"/>neither the Law of the Land, nor the virtue and ſolemnity of the Matrimonial Promiſe have force enough to ſolder together two oppoſite things, ſuch as are the two extremities of Life; betwixt which nature ſeems to have made a double divorce, as well in the diſſimilitude of the properties of the Body, as of the paſſions of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>The Latins called Marriage <hi>(Conjugium)</hi> a term very proper which ſignifies the coupling together of the Husband and Wife, under the ſame Yoke. This Conjunction is made for three ends; Firſt, that they may ſpend their Life more pleaſantly in that Society: Secondly, For the propagation of the kind: And laſtly, That Children being diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one from another by Marriage, the care of their education ſhould be divided amongſt the Fathers and Mothers, that they might thereby oblige them to help and ſuccour their Parents when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come old or infirm.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three ends cannot be well accompliſhed, if the Husband and Wife be not well matched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Yoke. For that purpoſe they ought to be very near of the ſame age, the ſame manners, and of the ſame mind: otherwiſe it is impoſſible that one ſhould ever be meet for the other. Two Horſes very young are too wanton to be yoked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, if the one be too young, he draws away the other; if he be too old he retards him: if they be both old, it is a common hinderance: if the one be tractable and the other froward, they make no way; and if they be both froward they go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. When the ſame difficulties happen in marriage, the contentment of living comfortably together, and the mutual ſuccour which is drawn from the affection of Parents towards their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and of Children towards their Parents, which is the chief end of that ſociety, is quite loſt.</p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:29522:90"/>
                  <p>It is certainly very difficult to have the ſame Houſe, the ſame Fire, the ſame Table, the ſame Bed, the ſame Intereſts, the ſame Children, and to live happily together, and not to have the ſame Mind and Will. All theſe circumſtances do from time to time furniſh new matter of love or hatred, according as Marriages are fortunate or unlucky. And therefore we find no affection that graſps ſo cloſe as the love of a good Wife and good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, becauſe living always together they render one another upon all occaſions a thouſand little of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, which are ſo many common ties that make new knots in the Soul, whereof the one never ſlackens but the other is untied.</p>
                  <p>If likewiſe the Husband and Wife agree not well together, beſide that it is a puniſhment to them as long as they live, their miſunderſtanding in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of their actions inſtils on either ſide a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon averſion into the blood and ſpirits, whereof the venom is propagated to the Poſterity, it being impoſſible that two natures betwixt whom there is ſo little ſympathy can ever produce a good gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and perhaps from hence proceeds the little love of Parents to Children, of Children to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and of Brothers and Siſters amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which upon the contrary reaſon ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to Children that are begotten in a happy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
                  <p>My deareſt Children, Sons and Daughters, though ye be not as yet of age to know what is to be done, and what not, yet your Mother and I are already ſo well ſatisfied with the reſpect and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that ye yield to us, and with a certain ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of brotherly love which you have for one another, above what can be expected from your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that we have ground to believe that your good nature is an effect of that perfect corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:29522:90"/>that is betwixt your Mother and me, communicated to the blood and ſpirits from whence you have your original. Ye may very well perceive what bleſſing we enjoy in our marriage, and what ye may expect, if God beſtow the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour on you, as he hath done upon us. For the obtaining of that, there is ſo much circumſpection to be uſed, that it is impoſſible for the prudence of man to foreſee all the neceſſary cautions. The Wiſe Man informs us that the induſtry and care of man may procure him other bleſſings, but that a wiſe Woman is the gift of God. The ſureſt way to find her is to ſleep as <hi>Adam</hi> did, I mean that having your eyes ſhut and your other paſſions at reſt, you ſhould expect her from the hand of God, and that you ſhould beg of him only without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to your ſelves any other deſign, that he would give you a helper ſutable and meet for you. In this manner was your Mothers marriage and mine made up, wherein we have both this bleſſing, that ſhe is ſatisfied with me, and I ſo much with her that ſhould I ſay that there is nothing more to be deſire but the only content which I find in her, I think I ſhould ſpeak modeſtly enough: our union by the mercy of God is ſo perfect, that</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of the Duty of Parents towards their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and of Children towards their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</head>
                  <p>I Have juſt now ſhewn you, my Children, that the firſt ſociety that was ever made in the world, is that of Husband and Wife. The ſecond which ſprings from it, is that of Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; in conformity to that order the firſt place in our affections, is due to the firſt, and the next to the ſecond. When the firſt is perfect, it unites two Bodies and two Souls into one, from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds an union betwixt Man and Wife as dear and intimate to them, as the love of our ſelves is to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of us. The Bond of the other Society which is between Parents and Children, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more ſlack, being but at firſt a bare inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the continuing the progreſs of nature, whoſe Laboratory would quickly be idle, if for the preſervation of the ſeveral kinds that fill it, ſhe had not ſtampt on every living creature a deſire to bring up, and have a care of what they bring forth into the World.</p>
                  <p>There is no doubt but that this firſt appetite is common to us with all other living creatures, and that it appears ever often more tender in ſome of them than in Man. But ſeeing the care of their young extends no farther than the Body, and that ſo ſoon as they are in condition to provide for themſelves, and have left the Neſt and Kennel: that tie of nature leaves no more any mark of it ſelf, it appears that there ought to be a great difference
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:29522:91"/>betwixt the parental affection of Man and that of the Beaſt; for beſides that of all living Creatures Man comes into the World moſt deſtitute of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and longeſt without ability to provide for himſelf, he is likewiſe compoſed of two parts, the Soul and the Body, which both ſtand equally in need of Food and Education. The care of both concerns the Parents, wherein it is impoſſible for them to make a compleat progreſs, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to feel it, but that there muſt be formed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, by reaſon of knowledg, an affection wholly ſpiritual, and altogether different from that rude and blind inclination which appears in other living Creatures towards their Parents.</p>
                  <p>If our care did terminate ſimply in the Body, as theirs doth, our Children being bred like Beaſts, ſhould not tranſgreſs the order of nature, if they were no more reſpectful nor thankful to us than Beaſts are to thoſe that have given them Life. All Duty between us would ceaſe, ſo as the Body ſtood no more in need of aſſiſtance; and it would even be to be feared, that the Child who had received no other impreſſion of pleaſure but what was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, might not have juſt cauſe to complain of his Parents, if they afforded him not the means to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie it. We ſee in the Life of Countrey Clowns an inſtance evident enough of the neglect of pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duty in reſpect of the Soul, in that we find not amongſt them but a very obſcure ſentiment of friendſhip betwixt the Father and the Son, the Son and the Father, and the Brother and Brother, which ſubſiſts only becauſe their fellowſhip in labour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it. The cauſe of that hardneſs of heart proceeds from nothing elſe but their Education, the care of which aimed only at the body, and that by the ordinary commerce that they have with Beaſts, they contract a middle way of living
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:29522:92"/>betwixt that of Beaſts and of a ſociable civil Man.</p>
                  <p>It is then unqueſtionable, that the care of the Body is but the rough draught of paternal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that that of the Soul gives it the laſt ſtroaks. And therefore our firſt duty towards you, my Children, conſiſts in theſe two points, and from which alſo ſhould ſpring your gratitude towards your Mother and me.</p>
                  <p>As we both concur in begetting of you, and that ye are made up of two parts, the Body and the Soul, it ſeems likewiſe to be the will of prudent nature that you ſhould have two births, and that for our common comfort the care of theſe ſhould be divided betwixt us. The firſt hath been the birth of your Body, whereof your Mother alone hath had the charge, by bearing of you nine moneths in her Womb, and afterward bringing you forth into the World. The giving of you Suck, the Cradle, Blankets, Clouts, the trouble of carrying of you conſtantly in her Arms, all this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer toyl concerns her ſtill, until that your ſecond birth diſcover it ſelf in the actions of the Soul: then it is that I muſt alſo take my turn and labour by ſuffering in breeding of you, all the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of your ſecond birth, before that ye become perfect Men.</p>
                  <p>There is ſome ſecret Myſtery in it, that the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Soul are younger than thoſe of the Body, and that they appear laſt. God hath ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, that by the ſervice of the Body that goes firſt, and which is groſs and external, we might be taught what ought to be our duty towards the Soul, which is more internal, and harder to be diſcovered. So ſoon as the body is born, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare clean Clouts for it, lay it on the back with the eyes upward, ſtretch out its arms and legs in their
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:29522:92"/>moſt natural poſture, and ſwadle it in a faſt and eaſie ſwathing Band, to keep all its Members in a convenient ſituation for fear of diſlocation. The ſame method muſt be obſerved, as ſoon as the Soul hath given the firſt indication of its birth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion muſt be made of wiſe and innocent counſels for its poſtures: we muſt lay it ſo as that it may look upwards, by raiſing its knowledg towards Heaven, to which it ſhould aſpire; rectifie the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and affections of it, which are its members; keep them in their place and duty by an eaſie, yet cloſe reſtraint, to the end that their operation may not be ſubjected to the tyranny of a ſcrupulous and ſuperſtitious conduct; nor be looſened and ſlacken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the tumultuary impulſe of the will. The Arms and Legs of the Infant are for ſome time kept wrapt up in Swathing Bands, and are not ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, till both have given ſome token of ſtrength; to inſtruct us, as I think, that the uſe and liberty of our will is never to be allowed us, before that the Soul hath given ſome manifeſt ſign of its ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to govern it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Negligence in the firſt Swadling of the Body and Soul gives the beginning to all the defects and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of both, Uſe and cuſtom compleats them. Wherefore the Soul being naturally more ready to receive a good or bad impreſſion than the Body, we ſhould keep watch to obſerve its firſt blowing, and to begin to train it in a conſtant ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of good, from the very inſtant that it hath given the firſt ſign of Life.</p>
                  <p>Child, it is altogether impoſſible that you could have articulated your words according to the accent and uſe of your Country, without applying of ſome attention. It is not done by chance, your ear by ſome occult virtue muſt of neceſſity have made the diſtinction of ſounds, and your eye obſerved the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:29522:93"/>of the lips of thoſe that are about you, and that afterward another hidden faculty have made the compoſition of them, though you have not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt twilight of the mind diſcovers it ſelf in this action, and this external articulation of words produceth a manifeſt though confuſed image, of the firſt internal reaſoning that is in us. It is therefore my opinion that as ſoon s male Children begin to have the uſe of their Tongue, Women ſhould be removed from them, and diſcreet Men put in their place, who beſides the care of their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling concerns ſhould likewiſe take the inſpection of their primary deportments, and behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with circumſpection in their preſence (I ſpeak of perſons of quality) for indeed manners become good or bad, according to their firſt pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns.</p>
                  <p>If we ſee (as it often happens) ſome vices natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralized in Families, and become a part of the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance; that flows only from the contagion of the Parents or Servants, who are of ſo looſe and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Life, that they have not the power to forbear but a little their diſſolute courſes in the preſence of their Children or Maſters.</p>
                  <p>Since then an Infants ſpeech is the dawning of his Soul, I think the care of his conduct ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with it, conſidering the dominion of cuſtom whereof nothing can give us a more ſpeaking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation than ſpeech it ſelf. The Eye ſees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing when it is framed, neither does the Ear hear but confuſedly and without making any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent diſtinction of the kinds of ſounds, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the operation of the Mind muſt as yet be but confuſed and undiſtinct: Nevertheleſs we find that by the often hearing of words ſpoken, theſe three faculties of hearing, ſeeing, and reaſoning, do
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:29522:93"/>(though imperfectly) concur, to frame by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent hearing and imitation of the voice, the ſame underſtanding, ſound, and accent of the impreſſion which they have received, and from thence proceeds the difference of idioms.</p>
                  <p>Think it not then ſtrange, my Friends, if I have always an eye over you; and if I begin ſo ſoon to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you: In obſerving of you, and thoſe that are about you, I my ſelf ſtand upon my guard, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is contagious may paſs in your preſence. It is as eaſie to ſpeak well as ill, and to do good, as bad: Good and bad manners are formed in us by example, as language by a good or bad accent, without any other ſtudy but uſe and cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome other duties ſtill of a good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beſides that of your inſtitution, which I ought not to hope to be ale to render to you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the difference of our ages, unleſs nature will be pleaſed to ſuſpend the execution of her laws in favour of me.</p>
                  <p>One is to uſe familiarity with our Children, and make them intimate with us: It is more becoming, in my opinion, to reaſon, than to trifle and play the fool with them: And ſince we make our ſelves ſharers of their paſtimes and entertainment, ſo ſoon as they begin to walk and ſpeak, which is but a mere action of the ſenſitive Soul; when the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable acts in them, and they become Men, it is unjuſt and out of time to deny them the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a familiarity whereof they have already in their infancy got the poſſeſſion. Conſider what befals us by a ſevere and rigid countenance toward them: we have gained their affection by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of cares, which we have heretofore had of them, and we loſe the effect of them by an idle policy of diſtance and reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Children, if God give you grace one day to be
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:29522:94"/>Parents, make your Children your firſt Friends, when they be of age to be ſo; their friendſhip is a graffing of natural Slips into a natural Stock which produceth better and more pleaſant Fruit, than any other ſtrange and baſtard graffing, which retains always ſomewhat of the roughneſs of its wild ſtock.</p>
                  <p>When they are become men, and perhaps wiſer than your ſelves, change the quality of Father into that of elder Brother. This laſt is common to us all; the other is but an alliance contracted by Blood, and by conſequence you cannot follow the order of nature; if when your Children are grown up to the perfect ſtate of Men, you treat them not rather as their elder Brother, than as their Father, Acquaint them with your houſhold affairs ſo ſoon as they are capable to underſtand them. You and they both will thereby reap this advantage; that in the firſt place by letting them underſtand what is your revenue, and what your charges, they will undeceive themſelves of the opinion that they might have, that you may allow them a larger Portion than you do; and ſo preſerve their affection. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by calling them into that ſociety they will eaſe you of part of your care. And in the third place they will learn the management of an eſtate whereof they are one day to be proprietors, and will by that means know what portion of it every one of them is to expect; which will make them more ſatisfied with their ſhares, and more cordial in their love to one another, when you ſhall leave to them the entire poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, It is very dangerous for Fathers to be too great husbands of their Purſe toward their Children, left that too much ſparing may debaſe them, when they have not means to ſet themſelves forward if they can. From being Citizens of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:29522:94"/>World, they are thereby confined as Priſoners to the Chimney-corner or Precincts of the Houſe: and it happens often that for want of ſomewhat to be husbands of, being incapable of all aeconomy, they grow prodigal in their abundance, becauſe that they never learned in their neceſſity the art of ſpending to purpoſe. In fine he that never allows his Children any ſhare in his Eſtate but when he dies, does no more oblige them, than he that leaves us his Spoil, becauſe he cannot carry it with him.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the Duty of Children toward their Parents, prudent nature hath thought fit that when we come into the World the ſame ligament that ſuſtains us, and which as a Conduit-Pipe conveys to us our nouriſhment for the ſpace of nine moneths, ſhould ſtill remain faſtened to our Womb-bed, and not break of it ſelf as all the other Membranes wherein we are wrapt; to be to us a viſible mark, that the ligaments which ſuſtain the Soul, and which give it Life by wiſe inſtruction, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand teſtimonies of love and good will which chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren receive from their Parents, ſhould be ſtronger and leſs apt to break than that.</p>
                  <p>The burden of the big Belly, the Pains in Child-bearing, the ſervitude of giving Suck; of taking up and putting to Bed, of keeping clean, inſtructing, and on all occaſions furniſhing all that is needful for the ſubſiſtence of Body and Soul, are ſo many various chains of Parents toward their Children, from whence ſpring an equal number of links of the ſame metal and workmanſhip which tie Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their Parents.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore one would think that the command of honouring Father and Mother were ſuperfluous, conſidering the obligation that lies on Men to do it; but God ſeeing that there were Souls ſo ungrate as to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:29522:95"/>fail in that duty, and even in the duty of love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf, which is more according to the laws of nature, he hath thought ſit that both Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould be written in the Tables of the Law, ſince they could not be graven on their Conſciences, to the end that thoſe who obey them not, ſhould be abominable to God and Men, as being convicted by their infidelity in theſe two, of treaſon againſt both.</p>
                  <p>My Children, I am already ſo far advanced in Age, and ye as yet ſo young, that in all probability your Mother will remain charged with the care of your inſtitution, as ſhe hath been already with all the troubles of your Infancy. She is ſo good and diſcreet, that I make no doubt but that you will find in her alone the affection both of a Father and Mother. If that come to paſs, as her good offices will be doubled towards you, ſo as ye deſire the bleſſing of God upon you, unite all the force and faculties of your Souls, to render to her alone the honour and reſpect which ye owe us both in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
                  <p>If I ſay nothing here in particular concerning the conduct of my Daughters, I would not have them believe that I have paſt them by in my Teſtament. That direction belongs to their Mother, who knows better than I how they ought to demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. She fears God, loves her Husband, is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Houſe, ſo humble and modeſt, and ſo wiſe and diſcreet that many times I ſtand in need of her counſel. Daughters, make uſe of that good example that ye have from her, and of her good counſels, and I aſſure my ſelf that if ye do ſo, they will be found better and more faithful to you, than thoſe which now I give to your Brothers.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. Of the Duty of Brothers amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</head>
                  <p>NExt to conjugal affection, and the love of Parents toward their Children, and Children toward their Parents, the third and ſtricteſt tie of Nature, is the love of Brethren to one another; they are like the Branches of the ſame Tree, which being nouriſhed by the ſame Sap, though they be different in Body ſhould bear Fruit of the ſame taſte, otherwiſe they give ground to ſuſpect that there hath been diverſity of Grafts. The Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that appears betwixt the two hands which are Siſters, and amongſt all the Fingers for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe of the Hand, is a leſſon of mutual love and aſſiſtance, which God gives to Children of the ſame Family, if they intend to follow his order.</p>
                  <p>There are commonly three things which cauſe the miſ-underſtanding that is ſeen amongſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The firſt and chief is an original fault of conformation and nature, which proceeds (as hath been already ſaid) from corruption in the maſs of their Parents blood it being altogether impoſſible, that a production which ſprings from the mixture of two diſagreeing ſeeds, can contain in it any thing that is ſociable, nor that any thing capable of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, can be produced by the diſſonance of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage full of diſcord and contrarieties. So that enmity amongſt Brethren is not only ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to themſelves; but makes an injurious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound to the diſhonour of their Parents, and in ſo doing breaks the ſecond Table of the Law, by
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:29522:96"/>the which they are commanded to honour them.</p>
                  <p>The partiality of Parents affection toward their Children, is the ſecond cauſe of miſunderſtanding amongſt Brethren, built (as I think) upon a very weak foundation: for if there were no violence in mens inclinations, which is not eaſie to be avoided, yet it often happens that one of your Children is more reſpectful and obedient to you than another, and that that difference of their reſpect and love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, begets another in you for them; and in that caſe, they who think themſelves wronged, have no reaſon to complain, in reſpect that they have been had Stewards of the mutual good will, which ought to be between them and their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
                  <p>There is another very conſiderable reaſon, why a Father ſhould not treat his Children equally with the ſame affection, and that is, when a Father per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a hopeful nature in a Child, which of it ſelf acquires ſome pre-eminence above the reſt, he is obliged to cultivate it with more care, and the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ought to conſent to this birth-right of good will, which in end has often no other deſign but the general good of all the Family. We ſee the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in nature; Amongſt the Branches that grow like Siſters from the top of the Trunk, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt draws always moſt nouriſhment to it ſelf, and the ſtock affords it more Sap than the reſt: If I in imitation of that example, my Children, be more liberal of my care and affection, to him that ſhall beſt deſerve it, I conjure you not to take it ill. I ſhould be very glad to ſee you ſtrive in emulation to gain this firſt place in my eſteem, I promiſe it upon the word of a good Father to the moſt virtuous; your endeavour to obtain it is as much in your power, it conſiſts only in abſtaining from evil and doing of good, which is a thing not at all above
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:29522:96"/>your ſtrength. Might I ſee in you a deſire ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to proſecute this goodly deſign, that my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations did reſt ſo equally ſuſpended amongſt you all, that neither ye nor I might ever be able to judg, to which ſide the balance ought to caſt.</p>
                  <p>The third and moſt ordinary cauſe of little love amongſt brethren, proceeds from the diſtribution of their portions: the wiſer Parents leave the diſpoſition of them to the cuſtom of the Country: which being according to Law, howſoever it be, is always bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and leſs ſubject to the jealouſie of our Children among themſelves, than our own. Our Eſtates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to our Families, and our Families to the State, whoſe publick ordinances we cannot tranſgreſs in favour of our Children, but that our memory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes odious to others, and amongſt them we ſow contention. When the Law (as in certain caſes it does) allows us the liberty of our will, it is rather a civil permiſſion that it hath given us, to keep our Children in more ſtrict ſubjection to their duty, than an abſolute power to deprive them of the right of their birth, to which they are called by common Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>To maintain a perfect union amongſt you, my Children, in this manner ſhould it be my opinion to diſpoſe of my Eſtate, if I had ſufficiency to give every one of you a competent ſhare. In the firſt place ſeeing that there are ſome times, and ages more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive than others; it ſhould be my deſign to aſſiſt every one of you according to your preſent need, and in that diſtribution which I ſhould make of my goods in my life time, to obſerve rather a Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical than Arithmetical Proportion. That diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which would evidence to you an equal affection, though there might be perhaps ſome inequality in the expence, ſhould, I think, ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you, ſeeing that therein I ſhould have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:29522:97"/>reſpect, but the common advancement of you all.</p>
                  <p>As to the diviſion of my goods after my death, be content I pray you, my Friends, that I transfer it to the Law of the Countrey where they are; I have but the uſe of them, the propriety belongs to it, and I can alter nothing in what it appoints, without offending the judgment of an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of wiſe perſons who have all agreed concerning the extent of its power; I muſt give them my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent upon my Death-Bed, otherwiſe I ſhall give ground to ſuſpect that I am ſicker in Mind than in Body.</p>
                  <p>It is true that our cuſtom is a little too indulgent, in remitting to our own diſpoſition all the Chattels and Purchaſes, and a third part of the ancient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; they are ſo many ſeeds of envy amongſt the Brothers, which a dying Father that thinks he leaves ſome ſtem in his Family more able than the reſt to maintain it, conſiders not ſufficiently; for it comes to paſs often that inſtead of continuing it, he diſperſes it by giving ſuch advantages, the affection of the younger to the elder abating as their part of the inheritance. Wherefore it is my opinion, that Fathers ſhould only accept of that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which the Law gives them, as an act of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility done to them, whereof they ſhould make no uſe. The Law which only aſſigns the firſt part of the real Eſtate and Inheritance to the Eldeſt, though it extend our power farther, ſeems to regulate our duty merely on that ſide, and to hint to us that as to the overplus we owe him but the ſame preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and advantage in our Chattels and Purchaſes, if we would follow the intention of it.</p>
                  <p>As to thoſe cuſtoms which give almoſt all to the Eldeſt, it is reaſonable alſo to comply with their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority being already paſt preſcription, and to ſuffer it
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:29522:97"/>as an old wound which is healed by time and long uſe, the pain of which is paſt. But when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelf grants this favour, it is a kind of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inheriting a part of his Children, which like a new wound makes a ſolution of continuity in that ſtrict union that ought to be in fraternal friendſhip; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſible but that the weakned parts ſhould bear a grudge and envy againſt thoſe which are the cauſe of their weakneſs, and that being even deſtitute of power to maintain themſelves, they ſhould be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of mutual affection to one another.</p>
                  <p>The only way to provide againſt this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is (as I have ſaid) to leave when we die the diſpoſition of our Eſtate to the Laws and received Cuſtoms: not to abuſe our ſelves with this vain folly of thinking to make our name immortal, when we our ſelves die, by an uſeleſs attempt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Eſtate whole. The duty of brotherly love is firſt in order, and more natural than the deſire of preſerving our Inheritance, and by conſequence our chief care ſhould be bent to keep it in its place.</p>
                  <p>The Stock of Families, fruitful in the number of Children, is like a Tree ſurcharged with Fruit; a part of them fall of themſelves, another is beat down by Winds, and a third comes to maturity, ſo that its fruitfulneſs does neither exhauſt nor dry it.</p>
                  <p>According to this example we may confidently and ſecurely, remit to the conduct and providence of the Laws, the ordering of our Eſtates, and the duration of our poſterity; let us aſſure our ſelves that the undoing of both will be occaſioned rather by the miſunderſtanding of brothers among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than the plurality of their Portions. When there are many to be made, their ſhares will indeed be leſs, but in recompence of that their counſels and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:29522:98"/>forces will be redoubled by the conjunction of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hands and many heads together.</p>
                  <p>This union is far more helpful than that of the fabulous men with three Bodies and an hundred Hands, who being incorporated in one Trunk could not ſeparately ſever one another in ſeveral perſons, when brethren who are united together by a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual affection, though their perſons be divided, may continue inſeparable in all the functions of mutual aid and common defence; and being divided in place, in body and action, maintain the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of mind in all things, provided they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the inclination of nature, and that there has been no miſtake in their original conformation. Naturally the ſame ſpirit, the ſame blood, the ſame principle, and the ſame education ſhould produce the ſame inclinations and wills.</p>
                  <p>Children, the correſpondence which appears in the fraternity of the fingers of the hand, is a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to you of the duty of yours: a ſingle motion opens them altogether, and another ſhuts them; to teach you that all your wills ought to have but one common impulſe: and as in laborious actions where the effort of all the hand is neceſſary, the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle finger contributes as much as the thumb; ſo ſhould this ſerve you for example, that whatſoever inequality there may be amongſt you, yet your whole ſtrength conſiſts only in your union; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally though the three greateſt fingers be only em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in all manufactures, yet the other two are not debarred from a ſociety in the wages, that you may thereby underſtand, that the moſt active and intelligent amongſt you ſhould ſupply the neceſſities and defects of the weaker.</p>
                  <p>We have at preſent in our Family the experience of this ſuccour: but ſeeing the modeſty of him from whom we receive it, forbids me to publiſh it,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:29522:98"/>let us beſeech him, my Children, to permit us to render him from our Souls moſt hearty thanks, and to conſider him as a ſecret Buttreſs which ſerves to ſupport our Houſe, without being ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Under brotherly Love I comprehend the duty of all the kindred, until that degree wherein the Law permits them to contract new conſanguinity by the Bond of Marriage, all that is betwixt that branch and the Stock being but the ſame blood, is obliged to the ſame duty of reciprocal affection, according to the rank of its proximity. When this alliance advances farther, it is confounded in the publick Maſs, whence it is that the private duty of a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terminates at laſt in a civil obligation.</p>

               <div n="5" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. V. Of the Duty of Masters and Servants.</head>
                  <p>THe reciprocal duty that is between the Maſter and the Servant, is the fourth in order in civil ſociety. Though it be the moſt common opinion that the name of Maſter have its riſe only from an uſurpation made upon the publick and common li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, yet I am of a contrary Judgment. The Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Politick, as the Humane, is compoſed of parts that command, and parts which obey: ſuch in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as are found to have moſt reaſon and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have put themſelves according to nature in the poſſeſſion of command; and the reſt though many times the ſtronger and moſt virtuous, according to the ſame order, are reduced to the neceſſity of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe if they had all together aſpired to the command, there would have been no mutual ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:29522:99"/>and if they had likewiſe all ſubmitted to the duty of obedience, their ſervices would have been performed with confuſion, for want of order and conduct to guide and rule them.</p>
                  <p>To trace the matter to its original, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that force hath made the firſt diviſion of the Earth among Men, and that the poſſeſſion thereof hath been ſince warranted by common conſent, for avoiding a ſecond time this Primary Anarchy, during which all things were poſſeſt in diſorder and confuſion. They who got the greater ſhare in this diviſion, finding that they had more than they could employ and put to uſe, were conſtrained to call to a Partnerſhip of their Portions ſuch who had been unfortunate in the diſtribution, under ſuch free and eaſie conditions, as being well obſerved, I think there is no difference betwixt the Maſter and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant but only in name.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, according to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, both are caſt in the ſame Mould; according to the Law of the State, both are free, and both the Subjects of the ſame Prince; and by the Law of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, both they and the Prince himſelf are the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; none of us all whoever he be, can force a man of what baſe condition ſoever, to ſerve him unleſs he be willing. This priviledge is ſo common to us all that none but the King alone can break it.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, whatever inequality there is betwixt me and him whom I would have for my Servant, I cannot bargain with him for his Service, but that he ſtipulates with me for his Wages, and that ſo by contracting together he become my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual: as he is by our Covenants obliged to me. ſo am I to him; if he be my domeſtick, he enters into ſociety of houſe and fire with me; and though
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:29522:99"/>he eat at the lower Table, yet he is my dayly Gueſt, and I am even bound to protect and defend him againſt others.</p>
                  <p>What do you think that he whom you take for my Servant does for me, in recompence of ſo much care? He ſerves me: You are miſtaken, he ſerves himſelf: the ſame labour that he muſt do in his own houſe for a livelyhood he performs in mine; if he engage to me his will in my ſervice, mine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a pledge for his Wages; if I reap any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his ſervices, he is no loſer; if he medle in my affairs, it is ſoon perceived that he neglects not his own; if he labour my Land, he ſhares with me of the Fruits; if he dreſs my Victuals, he has the firſt taſting of them, he is at the pains, and I at all the expence. Our Partnerſhip appears in ſo many things, that all well conſidered, I think the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Maſter and Servant is nothing elſe but a ſociety contracted betwixt a poor man and a rich for their common profit, in which there is not any difference but of name.</p>
                  <p>It is not amiſs, my Son, that both of them ſhould know, that the diſtance betwixt them, is not ſo great as men think, to the end that the command of the one ſhould be more mild and eaſie, and that the other (though he ſerve) ſhould do nothing unworthy of the liberty of his condition. An honeſt Servant is the Maſters obſerver and watch, and a good Maſter the Servants example. And therefore there is no conjunction amongſt men, next to that of Husband and Wife, that hath more need to be well made, than this.</p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch as it is difficult that the Maſter and Servant can be always in ſo good correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence together, that there may not ſometime hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen little debates betwixt them: it is convenient that in matters of ſmall importance the Maſter
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:29522:100"/>ſhould ſometimes yield to give a little breath to the liberty of his Servant, for fear leſt by ſtriving to deprive him of all, he ſet him not on the deſire of recovering all, and ſo make him forſake his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                  <p>The repugnancy that we find in our ſelves to obey the will of another, proceeds from this, that our life being in it ſelf nothing elſe but an act of ſenſe and knowledge, it ſeems to us, when that act is not in our own power that we live rather by the ſoul of another, than by our own. That unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to obey which is natural to man ſprings from this, and therefore Nature and the Laws making no Servants, if they are not willing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, we ſhould have the prudence to treat ours with diſcretion, if we find our ſelves well ſerved by them, leſt that by the tediouſneſs of too rude and harſh a ſubjection we may give them cauſe of repentance.</p>
                  <p>For the quiet both of Maſter and Servant, it is many times neceſſary that the firſt were blind, and the other deaf. A clear ſighted Maſter if he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Servants too narrowly, ſhall never want freſh occaſion of vexing; he ſhould ſlight or not ſeem to take notice of part of their faults, when they are committed through want of skill or judgment, or even through a little itching humour of liberty, which would ſtill retain its right; they are to be excuſed, and the rather becauſe if the matter affect us, beyond reaſon, the trouble will remain, and the fault cannot be undone.</p>
                  <p>It is as neceſſary alſo that a Servant be not too quick in hearing; becauſe choler being a thin and ſubtle humour which eaſily mixes with maſtery, it is very hard that a Servant can ſo duely follow his Maſters directions, but that now and then he may give him ſome occaſion of being angry: from
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:29522:100"/>whence it comes to paſs that his troubled reaſon, imparts ſuddenly its diſorder to the tongue, and ſtrives to eaſe it ſelf by that member.</p>
                  <p>For two reaſons the Servant ought to be deaf at that time: Firſt, that he may not be obliged to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, becauſe his anſwering may make a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percuſſion of his fault in his Maſters mind, whereof ſilence weakens the force as of a ſtroak in the empty air: And ſecondly, that he may blunt the edge of the reproaches and injuries that are ſaid to him; the cutting ſenſe of which may give him ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from his Maſter if he be too attentive.</p>
                  <p>There are few other faults wherein a Maſter ought not to be indulgent, except thoſe that are committed againſt him with deliberation, and that tend to the offence of God. And then it is not to be reckoned a bare fault, it is a vice, or maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: when this happens, how uſeful ſoever a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant may be to you, turn him off, if he be not young enough to give hopes of amendment: have a care alſo if he be a hardned ſinner, that by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to reform him, you contract not ſomewhat of his pollution, and draw upon your ſelf ſome part of his ſcandal.</p>
                  <p>If you find that your Servant loves Gaming, Drinking, and the Debauchery of Women, be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he will likewiſe prove a Blaſphemer, and that it is altogether impoſſible, that with ſo many wicked qualities he can prove faithful to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſcandal that comes of it, if you keep him in your ſervice; theſe three firſt vices being no vices that go on credit, you muſt of neceſſity pay for them, or if any other Purſe beſides yours maintain them, you are, though ignorantly the Confident and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealer.</p>
                  <p>If you would have your Servant be faithful to you, be ſo firſt to him by honeſtly paying of him
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:29522:101"/>his wages; force him not by keeping back his hire, to pay himſelf with his own hands, leſt that you both become culpable at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>The Teeth in the conſtitution of the body of man are the emblem of what ſervants ſhould be in the compoſition of a Family, and what qualities they ought to have; the Teeth ſhould make the firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of our nouriſhment, be ſet in order, labour all, leſt that thoſe who are idle putrifie; be clean, to the end that nothing ſtick to them which may ſpoil them; and whole and ſound, leſt if they be hollow, ſomething of that they chew may remain and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them. Their duty is to chew and not to taſte; and according as they are ſound or rotten they give an indication of the good or bad diſpoſition of the body to which they are faſtned: It is juſt ſo with Servants.</p>
                  <p>My Children, that I may put an end to the duty that ought to be betwixt Maſters and Servants, as they came next in order after our Kindred in ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo ſhould they be in our affection. If you mind the Prayer which your Mother makes you ſay daily for our common preſervation, you will find your Houſhold Servants in that Rank: ſeeing our engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with one another is free and voluntary, let us not make it with them with a reſervation of heart.</p>
                  <p>All ſervice without affection wants reliſh, if it be performed to me with regret, though it be my due, yet I receive it ſtill with more regret, and there is nothing but the warmth of the heart that can ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it. Sure it is ſo, let us endeavour to be beloved of our Servants: the way to procure their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to love them, friendſhip cannot be interchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on other terms. If it be our deſign then to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract to us their affection, they being many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the greateſt part of the Loadſtone muſt be on our ſide, to the end that its uniting virtue may be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:29522:101"/>the better communicated to all, and produce its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in common.</p>
                  <p>I have not been ſo large on the duty of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, as on that of the Mater, becauſe the Maſter has always more power to compel the Servant to his duty, than he to refuſe it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. Of the Duty of Neighbours among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</head>
                  <p>THe duty of man would be of a narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and his acquaintance ſmall, were it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confined to the encloſure of his houſe. The earth is open on every ſide, that man may with more eaſe communicate with man; his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce when he comes out of the Family is with his Neighbours. Son, what do you think your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are? I'll tell you, they are only an overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſioned by the ſwelling of the firſt Families of the world, which being increaſed to too great a number, were forced to ſeparate and take a greater ſpace of earth to live in, than they had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed before; ſo that if you remount to your origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, you are a part of your Neighbours Family, or he is of yours.</p>
                  <p>Without tracing the matter ſo far as its ſource, a Family is very inconſiderable that hath not alliance, goſſipſhip, or conſanguinity with the greater part of the Neighbours of the ſame quality, not reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the injuries of time which effaceth all the tracts of ancient Kindred. So that, my Children, we are bound to live with them as if we were all Kinſmen, and the rather becauſe likewiſe from Kindred to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:29522:102"/>Neighbours, the common Bond which conſtitutes the ſtate is continued.</p>
                  <p>As our Kinsfolk are next, ſo our Neighbours are near to us, whom God has commanded us to love, not as our Kindred, but as our ſelves. In effect if our houſe be on fire, if we be ſick, afflicted, or in any preſſing neceſſity, our readieſt help comes from the hand of our Neighbour.</p>
                  <p>We are to one another the firſt object of our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the moſt helpful is always the neareſt of our Neighbours; witneſs the Samaritan in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who tough he was execrable to the Jews, was judge the Neighbour of him that had fallen into the hands of robbers, though he was the laſt that ſaw him, becauſe he took pity on him, when both the Prieſt and Levite, who ſaw him before, paſſed by without taking any care of him.</p>
                  <p>There are three things eſpecially, wherein if a man do not a little moderate his deſire, and do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf juſtice, he can very hardly prove a good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: one is the intereſt in Goods; the other inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Pleaſure; and the laſt, competition for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>As concerning intereſt in Goods, our Neighbours are either our equals, or ſtronger, or weaker than we: if we be equals, and there happen any debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, it falls preſently into a Law-Suit or a Quarrel: and as there is nothing ſo frail as man and his riches, from that conteſt it often happens, that two Neighbours of equal power break themſelves by claſhing together. As concerning the ſtrong and the weak, if he that is powerful be unjuſt, he is in his Country like a cancer in the fleſh, which by little and little devours all the parts about it, and grows always more malignant the more that it ſpreads.</p>
                  <p>If he that is poor and weak be froward, he is troubleſom in his neighbourhood, as a hand-worm
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:29522:102"/>in the skin, which for all it is ſo little, fails not to cauſe ſmarting, itching, and inflammation. God keep you from theſe two kinds of Neighbours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you muſt always anoint the one, and by ſcratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other, you pluck off the skin.</p>
                  <p>Intereſt in Goods is common to all ſorts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; intereſt in Pleaſure that may occaſion trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amongſt Neighbours, ſuch as hunting, concerns only the Gentry; the Farmer labours the ground, the Tradeſman works, the Merchant follows his Traffick, and the man of affairs his buſineſs: ſo that none but Gentlemen are idle; and ſeeing when they are in the fields together they have but one common divertiſement, which is hunting: it is very hard for them to take ſo good meaſures, but that there may happen many times amongſt them ſome debate.</p>
                  <p>Children, if you will follow my counſel, you ſhall not delight in hunting no more than I; but if you love ſport, and have Neighbours never ſo little touchy, I charge you for fear of dipleaſing of them, that you be ever more ſevere to your ſelves than the Laws of the King, who have regulated the duty of every one in that matter. And if you have any Neighbour prepoſſeſſed with that paſſion, ſince you ſee that it makes him to more than he can: excuſe him if he do more than the Law allows him.</p>
                  <p>The pains that he takes in this exerciſe, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of body after hunting, ſhould incline you to think, that he who is addicted to that paſſion is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſſeſſed than delighted, and that the convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and tranſports of it deſerve better an exorciſt, and your compaſſion, than reſentment. As to Hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Fowling, which is gluttonous, and minds the belly more than the exerciſe of body, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of the mind, it is reaſonable that every one ſhould follow this divertiſement.</p>
                  <p>Hunting makes one part of the Civil War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:29522:103"/>Gentlemen; and competition for Honour the other. This laſt point is ſubject to ſo great a variety of emergents, that it hath been impoſſible that the Laws could ſo foreſee and adjuſt the duty of every particular perſon, that there ſhould remain no occaſion of noiſe among men. In this matter, my Son, it is my advice, that you govern your ſelf after this manner.</p>
                  <p>In thoſe places where the order of the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that you ſhould keep your rank, do it with ſo much diſcretion, that though the Law give it you, it may yet appear that you receive it from the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie of him that yields to you. Be ſo tender of the honour of another, that men may ſee you far rather inclined to remit ſomewhat of your own, than to uſurp any thing of what is your neighbours. In pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces indifferent, and on rencounters, fear not to be over-reſpectful; honour is like the ſtream of a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which comes upon us with more violence, when we ſtem its courſe than when we follow it: above all things, in the Church, which is the moſt common Theatre of the vanity of man, if any one invade your right, I command you to ſuffer it, you are in the preſence of God, to whom you owe that reverence, and before whom the humbleſt is always in the place of honour. If notwithſtanding you ſee that he take to himſelf the difference which you render to the Altar, there will be no danger, if he dares diſpute you your place, to make him ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that he is your inferiour.</p>
                  <p>Finally, ſince Peace is a bleſſing, we cannot ſay that we enjoy it, though it may be in the State, if we entertain it not with our neighbours. So that I judge a good neighbourhood to be abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the repoſe and quiet of life, and that the living near a bad neighbour is a fourth Flail of God, which being permanent is alone more dangerous
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:29522:103"/>than all the others together, which are but tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
                  <p>Imagine not, my Son, that none but he whoſe houſe joyns to yours, and your land to his, is your neighbour. The command that is given to you, to love your neighbour as your ſelf, would be too much contracted, if it were confined to him alone. Seeing the world is patent on all hands, and that you are free to go whitherſoever you pleaſe, you muſt know that he whom you meet, ſee and keep company with, where-ever you be, and of what condition ſoever he is, becomes a neighbour to you, and you to him; and that your preſences ingage you in a mutual duty of doing good to one another.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. Of Friends, and of three ſprings of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of man towards his Neighbour, which are Good will, Friendſhip, and Charity.</head>
                  <p>IN the Soul of man there are three ſprings of love towards his Neighbour, the firſt of which touches him but ſuperficially, by allowing him only ſome ſlight wiſhes of good, without the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of doing it. The Schools have named that ſuperficial good inclination, by too favourable a name, in calling it Benevolence, becauſe that every good inclination which helps not in time of need when it can do it, is not altogether innocent, and ſo cannot be good; and by conſequence (with our Doctors favour) I think that that inofficious inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul deſerves not ſo fair a name, as that of Benevolence, and that it is only a bare itching of nature toward good. Nevertheleſs it is true that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:29522:104"/>that inclination is a prediſpoſition to friendſhip, when he for whom we have it is touched with the ſame affection for us that we are for him; for then there is a concourſe of benevolence, which having no other deſign but to conciliate themſelves by a mutual complacency, mingle together with ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a harmony, that the ſolder that joyns them is altogether unperceptible: and from this conſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of benevolence proceeds the ſecond motion of the Soul in the love of our Neighbour, which we call friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two inclinations of affection which proceed from man, are imperfect, in that the firſt touches none but him that feels it, and that the ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards onely ſome particular perſons. The third that takes its original more high, is quite another thing, as being an efflammation of the heart of man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, which comes from God, and makes its reflexion towards our Neighbour, according to the extent and greatneſs of its principle; for as God is indifferently good, to the good, and to the bad, ſo man by his example becomes equally beneficent to all, to his enemies as well as his friends, without diſtinction of perſons or conditions; and this third ſpring of affection is called Charity.</p>
                  <p>So that then all the duty of man towards his Neighbour, is terminated either in Benevolence, which is an inofficious friendſhip; or in Friendſhip, which is an imperfect charity; or in Charity, which is a living lamp, and like a publick fire burns al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways for the uſe of thoſe that need it.</p>
                  <p>My Child, though the firſt of theſe three inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſeem only a tranſitory impreſſion, yet ſince neither friendſhip nor charity can be formed in us, but that benevolence hath gone before, I wiſh you may have that tenderneſs of heart, as being the Nurſing-mother of the other two: it is noble in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:29522:104"/>that it is diſintereſſed, otherwiſe if it were merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, one ſhould be benevolent to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And although it remain inofficious, yet it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to us in one draught an image of the goodneſs of God, who is univerſally benevolent to all his creatures, and another image of the negligence of man, who ſuffers in himſelf the fountain of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to good to dry up, for want of giving it a courſe.</p>
                  <p>Its courſe is opened two ways: when benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence within it ſelf is nothing but a good will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect, becomes active and mutual amongſt ſome particular perſons, then does it turn into friendſhip: and when it breaks forth upon all mankind, and indifferently offers it ſelf to the neceſſity of the firſt comer, and renders it ſelf one to all, and one to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one; then it becomes Charity. The practice of theſe two, my Child, is neceſſary to you, if you would acquit your ſelf well of your duty toward God, your ſelf, and your neighbour, which is the thing that I propoſed to my ſelf to inſtruct you in.</p>
                  <p>Now as to Friendſhip, me-thinks that the man who is incapable of it, is in the world and out of the world, like to thoſe barbarous and wild Iſlands, which are not only divided from the continent, but deſtitute of any way to enter, or to get out of them, as if provident nature, which does nothing in vain, had removed theſe places and men from commerce and ſociety, as parts infected, peſtered with mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and contagious to the whole. Friendſhip is ſo neceſſary to the life of man, that it were better for him to be deprived of all other bleſſings than of that, becauſe that without it he can have the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of no other good.</p>
                  <p>The want of friends is a kind of wilderneſs in the croud. Conſider that if you were alone to taſte all the pleaſures which the eye, the ear, the ſmelling
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:29522:105"/>afford, and all thoſe whereof any part of the body is capable, what reliſh they would have without the company of your friends. The attainment of all the good qualities that can be deſired to body and ſoul, is a beauty without grace, and a light ſtifled, if it be not communicated. In fine, without that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce which is entertained by the means of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, we ſeem to one another rather ſo many Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues on a Wall, or in a Porch, than ſo many men. This is a bleſſing of ſo great value, that it raiſes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the higheſt exaltation that humanity can ſuffer, it doubles, triples, quadruples, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it according to the number of ones friends.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients who would reſtrain its perfection only to two friends, by preſerving the memory of ſome famous couples, have not ſufficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood its whole extent: if it be true that our friend is our other ſelf, with this condition, there can be no friendſhip betwixt the good and the wicked, which are the two extremes; nor between the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and the wicked, who may indeed agree in ſome things, as far as their intereſt requires; but never in all, nor always. It remains then that it can only exiſt betwixt the good, whoſe actions are uniform, in that they are directed to that which is virtuous and honeſt.</p>
                  <p>This being ſo, as it is not more ſtrange to ſee many Needles touched by the Loadſtone turn al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to the ſame point, than to ſee two; it is leſs ſtrange to ſee an honeſt conſort of many perſons of honour, ſeeing that there is no virtue in nature, more attractive and unitive, than the concourſe and common conſpiration of good men toward good.</p>
                  <p>Could it be poſſible that there ſhould have been ſo little union amongſt thoſe that gave themſelves to the exerciſe of virtue, that the names which are
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:29522:105"/>uſed in the ancient Dialogues, were but only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed names, and that the ſtudy of Philoſophy could not have the power to conciliate a common affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the perſons ſpeaking, and ſome of their hearers? The narration of ſuch examples without doubt deſerved better to have been tranſmitted to us, than that of thoſe renowned couples of friends; unleſs it hath been perhaps judged that it ought not to have paſt to poſterity as an inſtance of a rare thing. In effect the action of a poor friend, who when he was dying, left by his will, (which was accepted and executed) his Mother to be entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one of his friends, and his Daughter to be married by another, and who ſubſtituted, the one failing, the other in this duty, is of a far higher pitch of friendſhip, than the action of him that gave himſelf in hoſtage for his friend; and nevertheleſs though it be more illuſtrious, it is leſs known, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch things were ſo ordinary amongſt virtuous perſons, that they were then looked upon but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as common actions.</p>
                  <p>Child, it is not enough to render a man one and the ſame with another, which is the effect of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to agree with him in intereſt, exerciſe, play, divertiſement, and in ſenſual pleaſures, which are all the appetites of the body, and of the inferiour part of the ſoul; an union contracted upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of theſe things, is diſſolved with its cauſe, which is ſubject to change: the identity which makes the union of two perſons in one, cannot be perfect if it have not its original in the ſuperior part of the ſoul, which conſtitutes the eſſential form of man: For that effect it is neceſſary that we be one, even in our ſelves, before that we can be ſo with another, becauſe that one who is diſcordant with himſelf, can never make a good harmony with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:29522:106"/>
                  <p>Since then there is nothing but virtue alone that can produce in us that uniformity of ſoul, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that there is nothing but it alſo that can ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate us towards our friends in the ſame manner as we are to our ſelves. By directing all our actions as they do conſtantly and perpetually to a good end without ever turning aſide, we are never out of the ſame road. When we deſire honour, riches, and contentment, for our ſelves, we make the ſame wiſh for them, if we have the poſſeſſion of theſe, it is ſo much in common with them, that to make all the reſt reap the fruit, it is enough that one of us enjoy the bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>The ſame thing never happens to the wicked, who can ſuffer no body to ſhare with them in their good fortune. As they diſagree always with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they do ſo with others. A ſoul that is ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly toſſed, is more miſerable than a body whoſe Members are all disjoynted. Let me pray you, my Child, from this to take a horrour againſt vice, for two reaſons; firſt that you may not be deprived of content and complacency in your ſelf; and next, that you may redouble the faculties and powers of your ſoul towards good, by the Union that you ſhall contract with thoſe who make profeſſion of vertue as you do.</p>
                  <p>All friendſhip built upon another foundation is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective; betwixt Father and Son, the authority of the one and the ſubmiſſion of the other ſpoils the perfection of friendſhip; betwixt the Husband and Wife it is hermaphrodite amity; amongſt Brothers, blood contributes more to it than our choice, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Maſter and Servant, the diſtance is too great to ſuffer a conjunction.</p>
                  <p>So that it cannot be intirely perfect, unleſs it be abſtracted from all conſiderations but of that of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue alone: And as virtue brings under the ſame du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:29522:106"/>all ages, ſexes and conditions, it can likewiſe unite many perſons in one and the ſame mind; and by conſequent it is an old errour to think that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip cannot arrive at it's excellence and perfection but only between two friends; my friends friend is my friend, the friend of my friends friend, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe mine; provided that all of us have the ſame ſcope, which is the deſire of honeſt things.</p>
                  <p>This were a lovely Theory, if it could be put in practice; but that conformity of the Soul which the perfection of friendſhip requires is circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with circumſtances ſo nice and delicate, that they ſeem to be inconſiſtent together. For inſtance in friendſhip one would be the moſt beloved, becauſe the moſt beloved ſuppoſes the moſt lovely; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the agent is more noble than the patient, one deſires likewiſe to appear the greateſt lover, which is ſuch a contradiction as in effect deſtroys unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in our ſelves, and that which we ought to have with our friends.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certain that friendſhip in it's higheſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation is but a mental being, which like heroick virtue, exiſts only in our imagination: yet though it be impoſſible to attain to perfection in either, it is not altogether ſuperfluous to cut out the perfecteſt image that can be had of it, to the end that man who is the ſubject of virtue and friendſhip, may be the more violently allured to the exerciſe of both, by the higheſt and moſt excellent notion that he can conceive of their perfection.</p>
                  <p>Indeed virtue which is the bond of friendſhip, is of ſo ordinary a pitch in man, that if we bear not with the infirmities of one another, we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long friends: as he is unconſtant and fickle, ſo is his friendſhip liable to his failings, his pauſes and returns. He that pardons moſt, is moſt faithful, and honours moſt his choice. We cannot renounce

                  <p>Friendſhip is a ſpiritual hoſpitality, the right to which is transferred to poſterity. If we perceive that their friendſhip for us, is much leſs than ours for them, let us not be angry, they follow the univerſal motion of the world, where all things aſcend more weakly than they deſcend, even to the love of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren toward their Parents.</p>
                  <p>In fine, my Child the greateſt praiſe that can be given to a man, is to call him a good Friend, becauſe that ſuppoſes him to be virtuous; As on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry when that goodly name is applyed to a wicked perſon, the purity of it is defiled, and the thing that ought to be moſt precious amongſt men thrown out on the dunghil.</p>
                  <p>Though it ſeems when one devotes himſelf in particular to his friends, he takes himſelf off from Charity, whoſe obligation is more univerſal; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs becauſe that friendſhip is an affection more adapted to your meaſure than the other, which would have us become one to all in general, and one to every one in particular; I give you only my advice touching that which is moſt proportionate to you; to obtain the other, one muſt go out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and be divinely ſeized with that wiſe and holy fooliſhneſs of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>This divine tranſport is violent and painful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes an union betwixt God and man, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their extream diſtance. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may obſerve in the writings of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> reachings and throbs of love, which break forth
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:29522:108"/>like a flame of Nitre, whoſe vehemency denotes ſtill ſome reſiſtance in the matter. In St. <hi>John,</hi> we ſee the contrary; and ſeeing Friendſhip is more calm, and more fitted to the meaſure of men, then Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it ſeems the mildneſs of this affection is only to qualifie the violence of the other.</p>
                  <p>And for this reaſon, his love appears in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings as a cheriſhing, gentle, pure, and vivifying heat, always equal. This difference proceeds only from this, that the former ſeems to love man only for Gods ſake; having only had acquaintance with the divine nature of the Son of God, who diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to him when he was dazled with his ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning brightneſs.</p>
                  <p>The affection of the other is more tender, he loves man for Gods ſake, and man for man ſake; becauſe he had ſhared in the love of his maſter as God, and in his friendſhip as man, having been the beloved diſciple.</p>
                  <p>Charity is ſo high a virtue, that it makes man a coppy and image of God: by it he enters into the plenitude of his love, which makes a reflux towards all things created, if not, with ſo infinite an action, yet with the ſame extent of will and affection: in fine if it operate not where it is employed, it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates in the perſon from whom it proceeds, with ſo much efficacy, that the will alone, when the power is wanting, ſtands in ſtead of operation.</p>
                  <p>Scripture teacheth us, my Child, that God is love, and that he that abides in love abides in God, and God in him, and although that this virtue be wholly divine, yet the habits of benevolence and friendſhip, are two humane means, which diſpoſe and prepare the heart of man to receive the grace of that perfection; which is the third and moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed inclination of the Soul in the love of our neighbour.</p>

                  <p>YOur Neighbour comprehends all ſorts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, amongſt whom there are ſome good, ſome bad, and others of an ambiguous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who determine not themſelves to good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but according as example, or the preſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of ſenſe incline them.</p>
                  <p>Above all things avoid the company of men har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in wickedneſs, you can never amend them. The ſound parts cure not the corruption of the gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grened; look upon them as old uncurable ulcers, which communicate not only their contagion to the adjacent parts, but change the colour likewiſe of the parts contiguous to the adjacent. I would have you likewiſe know, that of all wicked perſons the hypocrite is the worſt. He aboliſhes the inward worſhip of God in himſelf, to make the outward an inſtrument of treachery, he is ſo much the more malicious, that under a livery which promiſes ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he intends to ſurpriſe you.</p>
                  <p>Covet for your inſtruction the company of honeſt and virtuous perſons; of whom you may find two ſorts: ſome live a retired life, that they may not be polluted with the contagion of other men: theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only a voice that cries in the deſart, <hi>Prepare the wayes of the Lord.</hi> I adviſe you not what purity ſoever they may have, to propoſe to your ſelf their example for imitation.</p>
                  <p>Others without renouncing of publick ſociety, converſe indifferently amongſt all kinds of men good or bad, ſtill preſerving an intention of well doing,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:29522:109"/>covet the familiarity of thoſe, if they be not, as Jeſus Chriſt was, the way, the light, and the life; they are in the way, illuminated by his light, and quickened in him.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt thoſe who are of a nature as yet inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to good, or evil, and who are only incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to either by an external cauſe, there are ſome ſo careleſs, that they can apply themſelves to no ſide whether good or bad. Frequent not the company of ſuch, for fear that you be condemned to the fire, like the fig-tree which bore no fruit. There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more active, that do evil rather by inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, than out of any bad inclination. To amend theſe, there is no more needful but to make them attentive to what they do.</p>
                  <p>If you be of the number of thoſe, my Son, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect a little upon your ſelf, and you ſhall find that your amendment is not out of your power. There is a third kind of men who are bad only for want of breeding; a Soul which produceth vices is not bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, no more than ground which brings forth bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and thorns. Would you make good uſe of both? cleanſe the one from its impurities by good exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and wiſe inſtructions, and the other from its thorns by grubbing them out: And then you ſhall find that the fruits which they bear will be fairer, better, and more abundant, than of a piece of ground or a Soul that is naturally barren.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. Of the duty between a Prince, and a Subject.</head>
                  <p>THere remains no more but that I ſhould tell you ſomewhat of the duty of a Subject towards his Prince, and of the Prince towards his Subject,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:29522:110"/>which is the moſt important of all. The duty of a Husband, Wife, Father, Children, Brothers, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Servant, Neighbours, and Friends, which are but the conſtituent parts of a State, is but a private obligation. As the name of Subject is general, and comprehends all theſe relations; and the name of King, a name of publick function and authority, ſo is there duty of a larger conſideration. Their names of Subject, and King, which are relative, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us that the ſubjection to true obedience in the one, is in the other an obligation to good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In effect the beſt model of government that can be in humane policy, is that in a ſtate we be all ſubject to one ſingle perſon. If we were all of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual condition, the ſtrong would oppreſs the weak, the cunning would overreach the more ſimple. And violence and fraud would reign in place of Juſtice; when on the other hand in an equal ſubjection, Jealouſie and emulation not only ceaſeth, but every one of us finds our private ſecurity under the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral protection of him, to whom we are all Subjects.</p>
                  <p>One King, one Faith, one Law, is an unity of State, which are reduced to ſuch an unity in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the King, that there have never been any defection from the Prince, but that the authority of the Law and the majeſty of Religion have been like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wounded; witneſs our civil wars, and thoſe whereof <hi>England</hi> hath been the Stage. Wherefore I command you, my Son, never to forſake the ſervice of the King, for what reaſon ſoever it may be. The Apoſtle teaches you that all power is of God, and that he that refiſts the power, refiſts the ordinance of God, and bringeth upon himſelf damnation. <hi>Be ſubject,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>not only for wrath,</hi> that is for fear of the Prince, <hi>but alſo for conſcience ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a duty of ſo ſtrict obligation amongſt us, that we had rather run the hazard of violating the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:29522:110"/>fundamental law of the State, which admits no woman to the Crown, than to fail in our reſpect to the lawful ſucceſſour, by honouring as our Maſter an imperfect embryo, whoſe ſex is not known before that it's birth declare it to be a male. Such an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal deference, which keeps a Kingdom in this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, muſt of neceſſity have more than humane war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and foundation.</p>
                  <p>It is in God alone, and for him only that Kings reign. Their Scepter, Crown, Anoynting, and the concourſe of people that flock to their obedience, are but the viſible ſigns of the inviſible power that does accompany them. What-ever they be, good or bad, reverence in them the commiſſion which they have from God; the good are given you for a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and the bad for a tryal if you be good, and a puniſhment if you be wicked.</p>
                  <p>As you ſee then that there is no interreign in the royalty, and that the Prince never dies, becauſe that when the one gives out, the other comes in; ſo likewiſe there ought to be no ceſſation in the duty of a Subject towards his Prince. When he renders to the Prince his due, and according to the counſel of the Apoſtle, pays tribute to whom tribute, cuſtom to whom cuſtom, fear to whom fear, and honour to whom honour is due, it is not a right of ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that he diſcharges, it is rather a right of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which he renders to the Prince, for the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his liberty under his protection.</p>
                  <p>By the means of the duty that he renders him, which is but of ſmall charge, in reſpect of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that he receives from him, provided it be not abuſed in the receiving and employing of it; the poor man in his thrift, the rich in the diſpoſal of his wealth, the tradeſman in his induſtry, and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in his traffick, do all retain an image of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, in that they live in ſecurity, and that there
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:29522:111"/>is not one amongſt them, how miſerable ſoever, that can be forced to ſerve another if he be not willing: real and effective ſubjection amongſt us concerns him only who engages voluntarily in it; and whoſoever can live by his induſtry at home, without Quarrels or Lawſuits, is as free in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily under the protection of the Prince, as the Prince himſelf in his State.</p>
                  <p>My child, you are of a quality that gives you the ſame immunities as the King enjoys, except the obligation of ſerving him in the Wars when you are required to it. I charge you once more, that the ſenſe of the honour of your privileges may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to anticipate that command. Your duty is ſo great that way, that the weight of Monarchy ſhould be ſo far from being uneaſie to you, that you ſubſiſt by it rather as a little Soveraign, ſeeing the ſmall eſtate that I leave you holds of the King in chief, and is erected into a Regality with Juriſdiction Civil and Criminal, which you may execute by your Offices under the authority of the Prince.</p>

                  <p>THere is nothing certainly that can render a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject more religious in his obedience to the Prince, than to repreſent to himſelf the miſeries which Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are wont to occaſion. In the firſt place Rage, which is the moſt ſtunning paſſion of the Soul, is the beginner of all; from whence it comes to paſs that there is not a part of the State, great or ſmall, which ſuffers not thereby convulſive motions.</p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:29522:111"/>
                  <p>During ſuch a kind of motion, all are at work, and yet nothing done in order: all Work-houſes keep holiday, and Shops are ſhut; there is no But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery but of men; the Bake-houſes, Markets, Entry of Proviſions, Arrival of Boats and Barges, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally all kinds of Services are ſtopt, except that of the Water-houſes, which furniſhes only with water; whilſt in the mean time the hungry Belly, which is the heavieſt taxation, craves, and calls for food.</p>
                  <p>The Calamities, to which men are expoſed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this ſtorm, are not to be numbered; for ſo ſoon as ever the reverence of the Prince is loſt, every thing becomes lawful, Sacriledg, Rapes, Pillage, Revenge; which come attended with ſo deadly a Train, that whileſt you hold your enemy by the Throat to take your revenge of him, another ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of yours kills you: when you have plundered and ſackt ſufficiently, and from a poor man become rich, your Booty renders you a Prey to another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent perſon, who robs you to make himſelf the prey of another; and ſo Plunder follows Plunder, and Murther, Murther, until that as in a fight of mad blind-men, their diſorder ceaſes for want of Competitours.</p>
                  <p>And if (as it happens often that Devils have a hand in great Tempeſts) ſome powerful Subject take this occaſion to make himſelf head of a Party, aſſure your ſelf that this Remedy is worſe than the Diſeaſe, and that he that would be the Tyrant of his King, would be ſo of you, and that with harder condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than thoſe which have given cauſe to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
                  <p>The moſt dangerous times for Seditions, are when we are at War with our Neighbours, and they in Arms: one day of Diſorder is enough in ſuch a conjuncture to make us deliver up with our hands to thoſe whom we have been accuſtomed to overcome,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:29522:112"/>our Fathers, Mothers, Wives, Children, our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Eſtates, Countrey, and our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>So terrible is the thought of all theſe horrid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations, that I think there can be nothing in the World which a Subject ought not rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, than to betake himſelf to that deſperate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, which cauſes ſo many evils in one only day, that many times intire Ages are little enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the loſſes. Neither our Children, nor our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens children, nor thoſe that ſpring from their Loins, can ſee an end of them: What is beyond them, affects us then no more but as a common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
                  <p>How terrible notwithſtanding that Seditions can be, they are but tranſient evils, which reſemble thoſe thicks Clouds which mount to the middle Region of the Air, where after much noiſe they burſt at length, being unable to riſe to the upper, which beats them back, and turns them into Hail and Thunder-Bolts, to waſte and ruine the very place from whence their Vapours and Exhalations did ariſe.</p>
                  <p>But foraſmuch as the duty and honor of the Prince are concerned, that he prove the Father and not the Flail of his People, it is his part to remove all ſort of matter that may occaſion ſuch Impoſthumes in the body of his State, that he may not be obliged to uſe the Cautere, and likewiſe they become not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable Botches: For it is moſt certain that if they who ſit at the Helm of Affairs content themſelves only to remedy the evils that come ſtealing upon them, without preventing and diverting of them by foreſight, it will often happen that their Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies will be like thoſe that are given in the agony of Death, which are not only uſeleſs to the Patient, but diſgraceful to the Phyſician.</p>
                  <p>And therefore as the Diſtempers which proceed from inanition, are the moſt dangerous, it is of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:29522:112"/>greateſt importance that the meaner ſort of people be not reduced to extream Poverty, for fear that they whoſe condition is ſomewhat better, may not grow dry, like Rivers when the Brooks that feed them are drained. It is alſo very convenient to leave ſomewhat beſide what is juſt neceſſary to the middle rank of people; from which there flows back al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome profit upon the lower: for indeed if theſe two parts from which the Prince draws his greateſt Aid, be once extenuated, it is to be feared that their weakneſs may be communicated to the whole body of the State, and that there may be as many wiſhes made for a change, as there are perſons that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt vexations are not always hardeſt to be born, ſuch as threaten a continuance are moſt irkſome; becauſe the ſenſe of preſent pain hath bounds, but the apprehenſion of its duration, none. Whence it comes to paſs that a weakneſs occaſioned by ſome heavy load, inſtead of abating turns to rage, when all hopes of amendment are gone.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon a Prince ought to avoid as much as poſſibly he can, all things that may render his Government terrible, to the end that he may not only be ſecure from all kinds of Rebellion, but that even the leaſt Tempeſt may not be raiſed in the minds of his Subjects, and that he may reign more abſolutely in their Hearts than over their Eſtates.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing that convinces us more of the perfection of the temper that is in this Kingdom betwixt the Prince and his Subjects, than the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Monarchy. We ſee no ſtate that can ſhow like ours ſo long a ſeries of Kings and years under one form of Government, which is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that the Harmony thereof is excellent.</p>
                  <p>The body Politick like the Natural, hath it's principles of long Life: They both ſubſiſt long,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:29522:113"/>when in their firſt conſtitution there happens a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Symmetry between the part that commands, and that which obeys. Not, but that it may be ſometimes diſturbed, and that as from the middle and lower regions of the Body there ariſe of ten undige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted Vapors which trouble the Brain, and from thence alſo there deſcend ſome Defluxions which overcharge the lower parts, the ſame diſorder may not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time be found betwixt the Prince and his Subjects: Yet when the firſt Conformation is good, there is always in it ſome radical and vivifying Spirit, that produces a Noble <hi>Craſis,</hi> which ſets all things again to right.</p>
                  <p>It is true there happen ſometimes croſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Conjunctures, that force the King to raiſe Taxes from his People; as when it is the publick Intereſt to entertain War for procuring of an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Peace. In ſuch occaſions it is very juſt that the People ſhould contribute to it with all their Might, and that the Prince likewiſe on his ſide ſhould remit ſomewhat of his advantages for facilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the overtures of Peace, for fear that if that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution ſhould always continue, the whole ſubſtance of the State might be exhauſted, and that at length the Forrein War, might become Inteſtine by the miſeries that it cauſes at home. For indeed, tho Forrein Wars be but like inflamed Bliſters that break out in the Skin, which are not ſo dangerous as internal Impoſthumes; yet for all that, they are very troubleſome and uneaſy, becauſe they are always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a great itching, which forces the hand by continual ſcratching at length to claw off the Skin.</p>
                  <p>All things rightly conſidered, War ſeems to be nothing but the flail of God, which Kings ſhould divert from themſelves, if they be able, as a thing that leſſens their Greatneſs by the loſs of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:29522:113"/>and the conſequence of an infinite number of Evils that attends it. God is the God of Peace and Love: A King who is the image of God upon earth, blots out in himſelf that reſemblance, if he be not, like him, a King of Peace and Love; but ſeeing Peace is a Bleſſing that was proclaimed by Angels at our Saviours coming into the World, and which was left by himſelf to his Apoſtles when he went out of it, we muſt expect it from God as a thing purely celeſtial. However the Prince ſhould preſerve in his mind a deſire to make it, and contribute thereto all that he can, that he may not have this diſpleaſure to ſee that his Reign is only conſiderable by the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which proceed from the iraſcible faculty of man.</p>
                  <p>In fine, My Son, that I may conclude your duty towards your Neighbour, break never Society with any who-ever, unleſs with perſons confirmed in wickedneſs.

                  <head>CHAP. XI. Counſels how we may not err in the mutual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of one towards another.</head>
                  <p>THat you may not err in any one of theſe duties, you muſt know, my Son, that there are three ſorts of Eyes that behold you, to wit, the eye of God, the eye of Man, and your Own: This being ſo, I adviſe you to carry your ſelf in publick, as if the eye of God obſerved none but you alone, and to live in private, as if all the World beheld you.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:29522:114"/>As to your own Eye, let there none, I pray you, that looks more narrowly on you, nor that you ſtand in awe of, than of it. By ſo doing you will retain your original Modeſty, which being nothing but a reflexion of the image of God that is in us, makes us delight in honeſt things, and aſhamed of what is otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Would you make a certain and infallible diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt that which is honeſt, and that which is not? Set your ſelf always in the place of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and reaſon thus within your ſelf: If any one, thought, did, or ſaid that which I am about to do, think or ſay, would it be an honeſt thing? The place of another is the true diſtance that you muſt take to make a right Judgment on it: If in that place you perceive it to be honeſt, do it boldly; if not, have a care of proceeding any farther. The greateſt part of Mortality conſiſts in that point, whereof one of the adventures of my life will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you an inſtance, which I ſhould be glad you did imitate.</p>
                  <p>A perſon alive at this day, whom I knew not, and have never ſeen ſince, nor he mee, came to me one day from a place at a pretty diſtance, and upon a Letter of Credit of another who ſhould not have had any ſuch confidence in me, propoſed to me a thing that was contrary to the ſervice of the King. At firſt it was in my thoughts to have cauſed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt him; but having put my ſelf in his place and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he did his Maſters Service, having ſeriouſly weighed what I ought to do on that occaſion, I let him go, though by ſo doing I put my own head in anger to ſave his. It is true that my peril was but doubtful and his certain. But ſeeing the place where I had then ſome command, run no risk by my ſo doing, that I performed the Kings ſervice more ſecurely, I took the courſe that ſeemed to me
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:29522:114"/>the honeſteſt. If the perſon in whoſe place I put my ſelf at that time, had put himſelf in mine, I ſhould have ſince in the ſpace of ten years received ſome word of thanks. The perſon that ſent the meſſenger, and he on whom I depended at that time, may very well call to mind the truth of this adventure, though not one of them to this hour know what was the chief motive to my action.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XII. The concluſion of the Work by a ſhort diſcourſe concerning Death, and of three things that uſually trouble the mind of Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death.</head>
                  <p>I Think, my Child, that I have now diſcourſed of your Conduct in all the actions of Life except the laſt, to wit, of Dying, which is rather a certain term where the life of Man ends, than an action of life. Since it is ſo, as the concluſion of a work is always bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than it's progreſs, in reſpect that then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it's accompliſhment; ſo I think alſo that the laſt inſtant which terminates our life, is that which is of moſt value. Death is good to the Good, in that they find therein their reſt, and the reward of their labour. It is good to the Wicked, in that it puts an end to their wickedneſs, which is aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated as their iniquity does increaſe. It is good to the Living, in that it frees them from the croud which is to them a common preſſure; and good in reſpect of Nature, in that it gives her a larger ſpace to contain her new Productions. All that is moſt
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:29522:115"/>terrible in it, is the depth of it's Abyſs: But ſeeing when we came into the World, we came out of the ſame Abyſs without fear, thither again we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn without aſtoniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Whether it be that our original deſcends from Heaven, which is not to be doubted, or that we have been taken out of the ſtill calm of Nothing, as ſome have believed; Nature hath been very prudent, in rendering that knowledg to us a little confuſed, leſt that otherways the trouble of our exile, or of our remove from a <hi>non</hi>-entity peaceable and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain, unto a reſtleſs and painful being, ſuch as ours is, might have afflicted us. She hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo very diſcreet in that, contrary to all reaſon, ſhe hath made the remembrance of our paſt calamities pleaſing to us, leſt that otherways the fear of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Evils might not ſet us upon the ſhortning of her courſe, and the anticipating of her appointment of Dying; but yet more wiſe by dazling us with ſome falſe light of apparent good in life, and engaging us to the love of it by the charms of Senſe, of our Works, and Children; and by having in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner obliged us to run out her courſe by the cuſtom of living, and to take care of our own preſervation by the fear of Annihilation.</p>
                  <p>It is not without cauſe that at firſt we appear in the World like Blind-men, without the knowledg of the gate by which we entered, or that we are, or where we are; for if our undeſtanding had a being as ſoon as our ſelves, and that it were not prejudicated by the cuſtom of ſeeing our ſelves in the World, we ſhould not be ſo nice in quitting the love of Life, which appears to us all ſo natural.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all the charms which life may boaſt of, yet I cannot imagine that there hath ever been any one bold enough to deſire to come into the World, if it had been in his own choice, and that he
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:29522:115"/>had been made to underſtand that for that end it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved him firſt to lurk nine Moneths in the Womb of a Woman, as in a Den, there to lye double like a ſhapeleſs Lump in a puddle of corrupt Blood, wherewith he is nouriſhed; to be dropt from thence with his head downward, with a gut like a Halter about his neck, ready to ſtrangle him; naked, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent and unable to help himſelf, and ſuffering already the inconveniences of life, before he begin to live.</p>
                  <p>Nature does the act of a good Mother in forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of us; for her principal intention is to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue her Productions, for maintaining of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, which ſhe ſatisfies by giving us Life: And by denying of us her aſſiſtance at our firſt ſtep into it, it ſeems ſhe intends to commit a charitable Homicide, that ſhe may have no hand in all thoſe evils which there we are to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, when I well conſider the conſtraint of Swadling, the naſtineſs of Clouts, the abundance of Tears that diſtil from our Eyes during our Infancy, the ignorance, chaſtiſement and correction to which our faireſt ſeaſon is expoſed: The impatience, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and irregularities of our ſtronger age: The fears, languiſhing, and faintings of our weaker; I think it hath been ſaid with good reaſon, that we are made up of two Executioners, to wit, the Body and the Soul, whereof the one puts us to the rack by Hunger, Thirſt, Labor, Weariſomneſs and Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and the other uſes us not more favourably by diſquietings, fears, and the tumults of our Paſſions and Deſires; and when we have all things at will, even by the ſurfeit that we contract through ſatiety. Man in that condition is like a Malefactor on the Wheel, to whom the Death's-ſtroke is the ſtroke of Grace.</p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:29522:116"/>
                  <p>Certainly, ſeeing that we are expoſed to ſuch legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Miſeries, it may with more reaſon be ſaid, that Life is the puniſhment of Sin, than Death; ſeeing there is nothing ſo grievous to be found in it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we look upon it as a ſleep of Nature, or a laſt duty which ſhe exacts from us.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, Sleep and Fainting, which are two means whereby before we die, we make a trial of the approaches of Death, ſhow us ſenſibly that we wear away without Pain. Beſide, natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon teacheth us that the Vital parts, which ſuffer moſt in this diſſolution, are the moſt inſenſible parts of all the Body; for ſhortneſs of Breath, the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pulſe, its weakneſs and intermiſſion, and the Convulſions which are the forerunners of Death, are not ſo much the ſigns of Pain, as of the ruine of a craſie Houſe which ſhakes when it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point of falling. The feebleneſs of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the ſhutting of the Teeth, Paleneſs, cold Sweats, loſs of Memory, ſuppreſſion of Speech, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Tongue, trembling of the Arteries, extinction of Sight, and the Hickock, are meer ſigns of the abundance of Vital Spirits which retire from all theſe parts with an irregular motion, which are indeed more painful to him that ſees, than to him that ſuffers them.</p>
                  <p>To convince us yet more evidently how ſlight a thing it is to die, there is not any paſſion of the Soul, how weak ſoever, that hath not a more abſolute Authority over us than the fear of Death; Revenge triumphs over it, Love deſpiſes it; Honor faces it; the ſhame of Ignominy embraces it; Affliction makes it it's refuge; and Fear prevents it. So that the preparatives and magazins that are made againſt ſo weak an Enemy, are rather the marks of Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe than Reſolution.</p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:29522:116"/>
                  <p>If it be lawful to touch the memory of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, from whence we have the lovelieſt Counſels that were ever given on that ſubject, we have more likelihood to ſuppoſe, that when he was ordered to die, the apprehenſion that he conceived of Death, occaſioned ſo forceable an attraction of his Blood and Spirits to the heart, that notwithſtanding the opening of the Veins of his Arms and Thighs, and the poyſon which he had taken, his Soul could not expire; than to believe, as it is recorded, that the languiſhing of his Agony was an effect of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his age. I am the more confirmed in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, becauſe they were fain to put him in a very hot Bath to extenuate his Blood and Spirits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed by the chillineſs of his fear, and to recal them from the heart whither they were retired, to the external Orifices, that by that way they might get out.</p>
                  <p>It is an evidence that that excellent Man had his Soul wholly infected with the black vapour of fear, that what ſubject ſoever he hath handled, he hath always like a huffing Captain, (for he was indeed of <hi>Cordova</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi>) mingled with it ſome Bravado a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Death, which makes me ſuſpect his courage, when I find him always grapleing with, (a word is enough) and never in any truce with that deadly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. It is better to be ſurprized by an evil of that nature, than to be in a neceſſity of anticipating of it by fear; for the Science which teaches us to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, is more ſharp and Corroſive than Lenitive, and the inſtructions that are given on this Subject, are only as the voice of a man in a fright, that makes a noiſe to encourage himſelf, wherein there is more of oſtentation than force.</p>
                  <p>He that ſaid that the end of Philoſophy is to teach us to die well, would have had more reaſon to ſay, that Philoſophy is to teach us to live well; becauſe that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:29522:117"/>the whole courſe of our life ſtands in need of reaſon for its conduct, and it ſeems that to die well there is only need of ignorance: Witneſs Beaſts and the inferior ſort of People, who are wont to run that Carreer undauntedly and unconcernedly, which is the lovelieſt frame of Soul that one can have on ſuch an occaſion.</p>
                  <p>In effect, when I conſider Death as a ſtill and quiet night of Nature, from whence all its produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions creep out, and where they return again to reſt, the depth and ſilence of that great Darkneſs cauſes in me more veneration than aſtoniſhment. I perceive that the time paſt is one part of that night, and the future the other; and that the preſent, which is but an inſtant, has ſo ſteep a deſcent from the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is not yet, towards the paſt which is no more, that my imagination it ſelf cannot trace it: So that the life of the World appears to me as our own, to be nothing elſe but a breaching in the future, and breathing out the paſt.</p>
                  <p>When I likewiſe conſider, that this flux of Life, betwixt the paſt and future, is in the beaſt meerly an act of Senſe which ends with it, and that in us it is an effect of the breathing of God, which emanating from that Divine Principle is Immortal as he is; Then do I look on Death with greater confidence. Though the Holy Scripture did not teach me that truth, yet our good and bad actions, whereof the good or bad ſmell deſcends to Poſterity, do evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove it to me: Our very Bones and the duſt of our Graves inſtruct me, that ſince the baſeſt part of us, which is common to the beaſt, out-lives us; there is not the leaſt ground to fear that the better part can be annihilated, which is a part of God in us.</p>
                  <p>In the times of our Fore-Fathers, whileſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens-gate was ſtill ſhut, a long life was the reward
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:29522:117"/>of the Upright: Since it hath been opened, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſtrives to enter it ſooner, and to prevent natural death by a civil, which conſiſts in the performance of certain Vows and Auſterities which ſerve to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and bring down Man during his life. But ſince I foreſee, that you and I are like to have too ſhort a breath for ſo high a deſign, I dare neither follow it my ſelf, nor adviſe it to you: For that end we muſt renounce the love of our ſelves, which in ſome manner is comprehended under the love of our Neighbour.</p>
                  <p>There is a time to live and a time to die, let us em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the time which we have to live, in the ſervice of God, in the exerciſe of Vertue; and in the mutual offices of Society, and we ſhall inſenſibly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear arrive at the time of death. The revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the natural day is an abridgment of the whole courſe of life. As we ſee that a wiſe man diſpoſes with order all his hours, without troubling himſelf about the hour of reſt, before Bed-time be come; ſo in like manner it ſhould be enough for us to regul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate all the actions of our life with ſo much inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and quietneſs, that the ſleep of Death may overtake us when we are doing the laſt act of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                  <p>Life is a duty active in good Offices, and Death a neceſſity of Nature that puts an end to it, which we ought not to fear, provided we watch, and have always Oyl in our Lmaps. The wiſe Virgins were a-ſleep as well as the fooliſh, when they waited for the Bridegroom, to ſhow us that it is impoſſible to be always on our guard in expecting of an hour which is uncertain, and that to enter into the Bridechamber with the Bridegroom, it is enough to make, as the wiſe Virgins did, proviſion of Oyl, that is to ſay, of good works: Otherways if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved us to be in a continual diſquiet for the hour
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:29522:118"/>of our death, inſtead of living we ſhould be in a perpetual trance.</p>
                  <p>When we die pining away through the defect of vital Spirits, the weakneſs of ſight, the thickneſs of Hearing, the debility of the Stomach, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs of Body, which are the forerunning meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Death, may very well give us ſome intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of it's approach: But when we are in the flower of our age, and that the vigour of Blood and Spirits cauſe in us tranſports of Joy which even pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our will; what can we then do to prepare our ſelves for Death, but to reſolve to live well?</p>
                  <p>That we may live well; we muſt, as much as we can, diſengage the Soul from the Body, purge it from it's luſts, it's affections and fears; ſtupifie our ſenſes; and to ſay better, annihilate our ſelves. This abſtraction of the Superior part from the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, is in ſome ſort an imitation of Death, which renders the life of a man that lives well, more calm by the reſemblance that it hath with Death, and his death more tranquile, by the conformity which it hath with his life.</p>
                  <p>In effect to live well is nothing elſe but to die well; becauſe every inſtant of our life is but a gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our age toward death; ſo that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that makes a leſs alteration in man than this laſt hour, ſeeing that every one of us purſues even to that moment the natural inclination of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of life. Which gave occaſion to a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver to call our laſt Will and Teſtament, the mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of our manners. This we ſee in that a man of buſineſs dies with his head full of affairs, the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs man, negligently; the grave man ſeriouſly; and they that are of a brisk and gay temper, with a Jeſt in their mouth.</p>
                  <p>Our Soul is quite otherways changed in other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. anger does ſo alter us, that there remains
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:29522:118"/>not in us the leaſt appearance of our ſelves: Fear by a ſingle aſſault ſeizes both our body and mind: Grief and ſadneſs blaſt both: And Envy by the foot that it forces out, lets us ſee too well what altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it cauſes within. This difference of impreſſion which is to be obſerved between death and our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, proceeds only from this, that Death is a meer natural motion, and that paſſions overtake us by an irregular impulſe, which puts Nature to the rack.</p>
                  <p>Although there be nothing more hid from Man, than the knowledg of the place from whence he came into the World, and of that from whence he muſt go out of it, which are two extremities out of his reach; the one being on this ſide, and the other beyond his being; nevertheleſs the power of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating of himſelf which he brings with him from the place from whence he came, demonſtrates to him that he hath his original from an Eternal Source, and in ſome manner aſſures him of his immortality. As to the place whither he returns when he takes leave of the World, the depth of its Abyſs frightens only him that looks on it, and not him that goes down into it: We muſt conſider it as ſleep, which is a repoſe to him that ſleeps, and appears a death to him that is awake.</p>
                  <p>Death cannot be an evil, becauſe Sleep, which is the image of it is a good. As the one refreſhes us, puts an end to the labour of the day, and reſtores our ſtrength for ſome time; ſo the other does us the ſame kindneſs for ever. As it makes a ceſſation in us of all the actions of the other functions of life, except of breathing; ſo likewiſe we may aſſure our ſelves, that though the action of the body die, yet the breath of the ſpirit of God which is in us, dies not, and that we ſhall as certainly riſe again from death, as we do awake from ſleep.</p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:29522:119"/>
                  <p>In fine, my Friends, let us look upon Death as a laſt act of Life, which we ought neither to fear at the hour of it, becauſe it is a duty of Nature; nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it before the time, that we may not forſake a warfare which is not to be left without order. If ſo be that ye conſider it ſo, ye will thereby alone find as much inſtruction for dying well, as there is in all the precepts for a good Life which I have given you.</p>
                  <p>There are three things which are wont to trouble the mind of a dying Man, the thought of what ſhall become of him after death, the care of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and of his poſterity.</p>
                  <p>To remedy the anxiety of what ſhall become of you after death, regulate the actions of your life, as if your good actions were alone ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you Salvation. Having done ſo, reſign your ſelf to the will of God, as if you hoped for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from his mercy alone. And ſo your works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified by your Faith, and your faith by your works, be aſſured that your Soul ſhall find all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation which it cannot receive when you die.</p>
                  <p>As to our memory after death, the memory of the Juſt being a ſweet Vapour that exhales from his paſt life, continues ſometime like a precious perfume which ſtill ſends out a ſteam, and fills the place where it dies with its good odour. But ſeeing there is nothing that hath a thinner body than a Vapor, there is nothing either that ſonner evaporates, than the Reputation of a living or dead man; it paſſes away like the beauty of pluckt flower, or it withers like the flower it ſelf when it hath remained too long on its ſtalk.</p>
                  <p>The lives of the moſt illuſtrious and ſparkling, as of the more dull and darkſome, are ſubject to the ſhipwrack of time. If any eſcape, ſtrange won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der! it is only to leave us an emblem of the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:29522:119"/>of worldly greatneſs, when we ſee the grandure of the higheſt abaſed in a Tavern-ſign, or in a Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming-houſe, where a Knave is better than a King, and where the moſt famous Names of all antiquity are expoſed to the inſolence of an huffing Gameſter, which tears and tramples on them at his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>How do we know, but it may be queſtioned one day which of the two <hi>Rouland</hi> or <hi>Lercanier</hi> was the Knight of the round Table or the Carter? this great debaſing of the vanity of Man comes to paſs, becauſe there is nothing Eternal and permanent but God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, who is a jealous God, and to whom only belongs Glory, Honour, and Praiſe, and not to Man.</p>
                  <p>The laſt care of Man, which reacheth beyond himſelf, is that of his Poſterity, the moſt univerſal of all; becauſe it is a kind of reſpite from death. I wiſh that when we come to die this care might be ſo moderate, that our conſcience, which has then enough to do about our own Salvation, might not be troubled, nor the ordinary courſe of the Law changed, the publick order of which is always bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than our private appointment. The advantages and entails which we are allowed to grant in favour of the Elder and of the Males, undoes one part of our Poſterity to preſerve the other. It is an evidence that in that there is more Vanity than Juſtice, that our caution and circumſpection holds good but for one time, which being expired, our inheritance falls in again into the common road, as being more conform to right reaſon, than our private diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>It leſs in our power to order the future than the preſent, whereof we are but very bad Stewards. What am I concerned, who am a dying man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Name and Eſtate be preſerved in the race of my eldeſt or youngeſt Son, or if both fall into the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:29522:120"/>Daughters lap? My blood is as much my blood in my Daughter, as in my Son; and though even this laſt prop of our line ſhould fail, Nature provides for it, and ſhows us ſenſibly that the difference is not great betwixt Nephews, Coſins, and Children, by repreſenting as well the manners and features of the Uncle or Grandfather in the moſt remote, as in the neareſt in blood.</p>
                  <p>So that, my deareſt Children, let us commit our ſelves and poſterity to the providence of God, that we may die with peace: When we came into the World we were not at all concerned with thoſe whom we found there before us, neither let us be ſo when we are going out of it, with thoſe whom we leave behind. Theſe two extremities being equally diſtant from our beginning, and from our end, ſhould be equally indifferent to us. The peace of a living man conſiſts in the obeying of God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and when he dies in the hope and confidence of his mercy: If in theſe two ye be ſtedfaſt, I hope that God in his goodneſs, will be pleaſed to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with his Grace, my Bleſſing which I leave you as the concluſion of my Will and Teſtament.</p>
